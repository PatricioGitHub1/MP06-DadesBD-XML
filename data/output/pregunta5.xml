        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a cool, dark, dry, place and whenever possible vacuum sealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oils in roasted coffee degrade as they are exposed to air (oxidization) as well as heat. As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine). Hard water can also have high levels of bicarbonate, though, which Hendon found could lead to more bitter flavors coming through.  - A Chemist Has Uncovered A Secret To Brewing Delicious Coffee At Home &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/a-chemist-has-uncovered-a-secret-to-delicious-coffee-2014-6#ixzz3Q3ecJSgz&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So depending on flavor preferences you might prefer your hard water at home but dislike it at work or simply prefer soft water altogether.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Tamping is one of three key controls you have over the espresso brewing process; The others are dose (the amount of coffee used) and grind coarseness.

Keep your variables the consistent and you'll be able to dial in the best end-product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been able to pull great shots using anything from just the weight of the tamper itself to my full weight pushed onto a puck, keeping all of the other factors where they needed to be to create the correct puck density.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See this video below for more detail: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholelattelove.com/community/videos/1854/quick-tip-what-is-the-right-way-to-tamp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What is the Right Way to Tamp?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Dosers exist to allow for predictably size quantities of grounds to be dispensed into the portafilter, and that's basically it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, however, conflicts with the &quot;Third Wave&quot; coffee culture, where flavor and texture are paramount.  In this new culture, coffee beans are ground for immediate use, rather than drawing from a bin.  The moment beans are ground, the gasses contained within (gasses that are the reason Crema exist) are allowed every opportunity to escape.  The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.  Advances in the packaging options for load cell sensors and simple controllers have made this somewhat common in both consumer and commercial equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In general, it's best to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; store ground coffee. If quality really matters, then the real answer is to back up. Try to grind only enough coffee for what you're using immediately to brew with. If you're buying preground coffee, then storage and optimal quality become somewhat trivial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the surface area of the coffee is increased (by grinding it), the majority of the coffee is exposed to air, accelerates the decomposition of the coffee, meaning it likely isn't going to stay fresh for long anyway. Think of it like opening a dry, red wine. Since it's been opened, it's going to turn faster than it being left in the bottle because it's been exposed to atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in short, if flavor and freshness really matter, try not to &lt;em&gt;store&lt;/em&gt; ground coffee if at all possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; store ground coffee, keep it sealed airtight.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Bitterness comes from over-extracting coffee. Over-extraction is mainly caused by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) brewing for too long: In the beginning of the brewing stage acidic flavors are first extracted, followed by sweetness.  And towards the end of the brew, only bitter flavors are extracted.  The trick is to stop the brewing just after all the sweetness is extracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction#Extraction_yield&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee extraction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yields of under 18% are &quot;under-extracted&quot;, specifically&#xA;  &quot;under-developed&quot; – desirable components have not been sufficiently&#xA;  extracted – and &quot;unbalanced&quot;, specifically sour, because acids are&#xA;  extracted early, while balancing sugars (sweetness) and bitter&#xA;  components are extracted later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yields of over 22% are &quot;over-extracted&quot;, specifically bitter, as&#xA;  bitter components continue to be extracted after acids and sugars have&#xA;  largely completed extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Grind size being to small: small grind size means larger total surface area of the particles.  Therefore, flavors get extracted more quickly and can lead to over-extraction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The optimal brew time and grind size vary depending on the method (french press, manual pour, espresso etc..), and you'll need to experiment to get it just right.  The type of coffee bean also matters, but probably to a lesser degree than the above two factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature affects extraction rate, but also varies between compounds in the coffee beans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you describe as a conical grinder is also known as a burr grinder. Burr grinders are important because they allow you to create ground coffee that is both homogenous and set to a specific granular size/coarseness.  This is a key feature and selling point of these grinders and it easily allows the user to grind for espresso one moment and drip coffee the next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In general, &lt;strong&gt;darker, arabica&lt;/strong&gt; roasts have less caffeine. Arabica (as opposed to robusta) inherently has less caffeine in it naturally, and darker coffees have less caffeine since they have been roasted longer or at higher temperatures, &lt;strike&gt;essentially &quot;burning&quot; the caffeine out of the bean.&#xA;&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some science, Arabica is usually found to be about 1.2% caffeine and Robusta is typically 2.2% caffeine&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeechemistry.com/agriculture/differences-between-arabica-and-robusta-coffee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Differences between Arabica and Robusta Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chris in AK has a great explanation in the comments as to why darker roasts are &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; to have less caffeine&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is a common misconception that darker roasts have less caffeine.  Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;"/>

For instance, when I am using my pour over at work, if my initial pour leaves some dry spots floating on top.  The Aeropress uses stirring prior to extraction presumably because the short time combined with the tube shape (narrow with all the grounds at the bottom) demand a good mixing.  I've seen many badly designed drip brewers that leave a chunk of dry grounds in the basket when done.  This is because the drip isn't dispersing water evenly and some of the grounds end up wasted,  finer grind, longer brew and temp won't necessarily help bad engineering in that case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's &lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00GK5R8IG&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;it's the best bet&lt;/a&gt; for Trader Joe's coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Water&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up the Aeropress for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;inverted brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;gooseneck kettle&lt;/a&gt; for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My results vary significantly. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment.

There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit Redux:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165&quot;&gt;mentioned below&lt;/a&gt;, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and &lt;a href=&quot;http://aeropresstimer.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;an app full of AeroPress recipes&lt;/a&gt;; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit The Third:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The results are in&lt;/a&gt;: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of &lt;strong&gt;freshly ground beans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the mesh metal filter&lt;/strong&gt; is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the plot thickens. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino&quot;&gt;colleague Robert&lt;/a&gt; asserts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &amp;lt; jitter &amp;gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it would seem that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The main reason for different grinds is the different brewing processes. If the water is exposed to the grounds for a very short amount of time (e.g., 10-15 seconds for espresso), you need a finer grind to provide enough surface area to extract the coffee from the beans. If the brewing time is long (e.g., the ~4 minutes of french press), you need a coarse grind to avoid over-extracting the grounds and getting something too bitter to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's really the heart of it. If the grind is too coarse for your brewing method, your coffee will end up under-extracted, weak, and acidic. If it is too fine a grind, your coffee ends up over-extracted and bitter. Your grinder is a good brand; if you still have the manual, it includes a guide to grind vs. brewing method. If not, the capresso.com site includes PDF versions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

For that reason, when I am dealing with fresh coffee, I may increase the pre-infusion time (from 5 to 9 seconds for example) and this helps make the espresso palatable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee&quot;&gt;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee&quot;&gt;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Cold Brew coffee.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full Immersion Cold Brew&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fresh &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CO2 Draft&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nitrogen Draft &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bottled &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice Drip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stumptown Draft Cold Brew&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cold Brew Draft&quot;&gt;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nitro Cold Brew&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article is helpful: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Generally knocking out the coffee will get rid of &gt;99% of the grounds from the previous pull, so the impact on the flavour of the next one will be so slight as to be unnoticeable. Usually the portafilter won't even have time to dry out, so the coffee won't dry on and clog up the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're making multiple coffees one after another, reusing the portafilter is probably acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However if you're leaving the coffee machine alone, it's best to at least rinse out the portafilter before you (or the next person) comes to use it.

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &amp;quot;decaffeinated&amp;quot;, they are better termed &amp;quot;uncaffeinated&amp;quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to know even more?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swiss Water process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you stop washing your mocha pot completely, you'll see a bit of a residue buildup  on the inside of the pot from many past cuppas imparting their special oils to surface. This &quot;seasoning&quot; is said to protect the brew from any off flavors that might be imparted by the bare metal of the pot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether this effect can be quantified by a perceptible difference in taste, I see no reason to part with tradition; it is a badge of honor and the sign of a well-used pot. At the very least, you are saving yourself a lot of trouble in having to clean it out each time. You can certainly clean the &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; with an appropriate cleaner if the patina isn't to your liking, but I would just rinse the inside with hot water. Liquid detergents have a way of imparting their own taste, and dishwashers will can quickly oxidize aluminum pots like the Bialetti.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The flavor constituents of roasted coffee are the result of high roasting temperatures. After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat). This energy can be in the immediate environment, a result of other chemical reactions, or already present in the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to a high-rep legit subreddit AskScience user,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Unlike all of the other posters in this thread, I have done this experiment. A cup of brewed coffee left at room temperature for 24 hours had about 60% of its caffeine remaining.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do is choose the right bean and the right roast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer roasting removes some of the caffeine from the bean, so a lighter roast would be preferred. Additionally you should chose Robusta beans, since their inherent caffeine content is higher than that of arabica beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is the grinding. The smaller you grind, the easier it is to extract &quot;material&quot; from the ground. This is due to the additional surface area you expose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the last step is the extraction. The longer you expose the ground to water, the more substances you absorb. The extraction roughly has three steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Extraction of Acidity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Extraction of Sweetness&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Extraction of Bitterness&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually you try to stop extraction after the second step, to have the coffee taste nicely. By that point in time most of the caffeine is already extracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you'd want to get &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the caffeine out of a ground, you'd have to go through with extracting the bitterness, too.

Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp.

Even if it does not for coffee the mildness of the diuretic is mostly compensated by the water intake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose in the case of espresso there may be a net loss of water, but it would still be very minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a doctor, so I have not fully researched this.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I prefer lattes in big wide cups as it allows me to enjoy it with a multitude of senses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of consuming starts by absorbing the warmth of the cup into my hands.

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xA;  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would close this question as &quot;Too broad&quot; but then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourced from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeebrewguides.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.coffeebrewguides.com/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As an American, I've never heard of a long black, but it sounds like a great idea. I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I would shoot to &lt;strong&gt;have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeedetective.com/what-is-the-correct-temperature-for-serving-coffee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Detective,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[American-style brewed] coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Does anyone have a setup in place that has very little (or better yet, no) smoke leakage when roasting?  What are the elements you have involved to create your smoke free roasting apparatus?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I finally noticed that the chaff collection unit is actually several pieces that don't fit as well as they could.  I took it apart and sealed the seams with high temperature engine gasket sealant.  I then used the sealant to connect the vent hose to the top of the chaff collector (also a very rough fit). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still have some problems with cold air inflow on the vent through the house wall, but I can disconnect the vent hose from the house vent and stuff it with rags or other temporary insulation material if I choose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All said and done the machine is leaking far less than half the smoke it was previously.  It seems the chaff collector was a main part of the problem.  This makes sense as the exhaust there is making a 90 degree turn, expanding into a chamber, then compressing back into another pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIJzw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIJzw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Complete misunderstanding of the problem.  The exhaust vent is sized down and WILL connect and properly seal on a piece of exhaust pipe fitting.  I am not sure why the company sized it this way, but sealing the seams and using a piece of exhaust joint (rather than slipping the vent hose/pipe over the exhaust) works like it was probably designed to.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If you don't have great ventilation in your house over your stove, accidental overroasts and dark roasts become a major problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A cup of coffee is definitely a solution, in the sense that it is composed of dissolved solutes. The solvation occurs once water is introduced. While, there is always a limit to how much of a substance can be solvated in a given amount of solvent, with coffee you're likely to not reach the point of creating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;super-saturated solution&lt;/a&gt; in normal conditions. If you were to take a pot of brewed coffee, and boil it, removing the solvent (water) you will likely reach a point as to where the solution is supersaturated, followed by precipitation of a crude extract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now is coffee an emulsion? I have heard that typical brewed coffee contains oils from the bean (likely oils that can be seen on darker roasts). If this is the case, then we could say that coffee is both a solution &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an emulsion!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I know this is an older question but I want to clarify some definitions:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Under IUPAC definition of an emulsion&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Note 4: An emulsion is termed an oil/water (o/w) emulsion if the&#xA;  dispersed phase is an &lt;strong&gt;organic material&lt;/strong&gt; and the continuous phase is&#xA;  water or an &lt;strong&gt;aqueous solution&lt;/strong&gt; and is termed water/oil (w/o) if the dispersed&#xA;  phase is water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is an&#xA;  organic liquid (an &quot;oil&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, when I say coffee is a solution, I'm referring to dissolved solids in the aqueous phase (an aqueous solution).

Had you gone to the emergency room, you probably could have expected to been given a laxative, activated charcoal, and possibly I.V. fluids. I doubt that they would have pumped your stomach over a single cup, but they might have if your heart was beating irregularly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absorption of most things you swallow generally depends on how much you've had to eat - so yes, eating something filling (e.g. bread soaked in water) would &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; have alleviated some of the discomfort, especially if you had the coffee on an empty stomach. Staying hydrated (but not over-hydrated) would also have been important. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't advise self-medicating in circumstances like this, all you can do is be very mindful of symptoms getting &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; (particularly any sign of irregular heart activity) while you wait it out and (eventually) crash into bed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, bread / crackers / water - not going to hurt, and &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; make you feel a little better, or better sooner. While symptomatic, I wouldn't take anything over the counter or prescription unless you checked with a doctor (because of possible heart implications)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And really, if you feel at all beyond 'blaugh' - you should see a doctor quickly.

What you'd have to look out for is the tincture possibly damaging the machine, which leaves very little room for trial and error (or margin for error at that). You'd also have to watch out for machines that need to 'validate' the capsule as 'authenticated' before agreeing to make coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note, I'm assuming you mean those &quot;Nespresso&quot; machines or similarly clever abominations.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly general question, so pardon me for a slightly generic answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing you'll want to consider is the quality of the coffee itself.  Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.  Ground coffee has more surface area to be exposed to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this addresses what you were asking properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

For instance I have started to only use this with my kettle and there is no limescale build up since switching 1 1/2 months ago, whilst before, using Brita filtered water would start to show limescale after a week and I'd need to descale after 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are the instructions on my descaling solution for a coffee machine:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Add 100ml of solution to 500ml of water and add to water reservoir,&#xA;  turn on and run through the machine. Then run 2 full reservoirs of&#xA;  water before using again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember with citric acid you had to pump it through and then leave for 30 minutes and then fully flush a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a youtube video from Gaggia about performing this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key thing here is that if you don't do it then limescale starts to form on the metal filter and gasket seals which will affect the flow rate. This isn't the worst bit though, like with any heating system that uses hard water, the hard limescale will inhibit the heating and pumping performance which can lead to a complete pump failure which is what happened to my machine, I recommend using citric acid (which is a weak acid and safe to consume in diluted form) and/or bottled mineral water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The difference with syrup or essence or flavouring is that the touch feels lighter and more natural.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A basic mechanism here is to mix ground coffee with some spice, and let the mixture sleep for flavour to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism is to put some spice directly in a container with roasted beans.

It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your second question.

Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. &#xA;  This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you and answers your questions!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It depends on the press. I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; a dishwasher&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They tend to be rather fragile&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; needing to clean it would slow down my consumption.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume that you've had an espresso. It's a small-cup of coffee extracted under very high pressure. It's delicious by itself and some like to add sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what is a latte?&#xA;Take a shot of espresso and add steamed milk &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is a cappuccino?&#xA;Take a shot of espresso and add steam milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino? Are they the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. (Unless you're in a really bad diner in which case you shouldn't be ordering lattes there.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several differences between a latte and a cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One is the ratio of milk to espresso. A cappuccino is 1-1 milk to espresso and the latte is 2-1 milk to espresso. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that the milk is treated differently. In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It gets more involved than this but I'll let others answer those questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I've actually been lucky enough to at one time have peaberry, oversized and &quot;regular&quot; beans all from the same lot.  The coffees all tasted exactly the same to me.  I have a friend that claimed he tasted some difference in in the larger beans, owing perhaps to not having been roasted as thoroughly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beans I had were Sumatran Toba Batak, sold in sorted lots of 17+, peaberry and regular.  I am sure that almost any processing station you went to in the world could do such processing if they chose, although it's probably labor intensive and would add some cost to the beans.  If Tanzania is doing it regularly, they have probably found it's financially worth it.  On occasion when I look closely at the beans I am roasting, I'll usually find a few peaberries in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Keeping the portafilter warm (and receiving / tamping a dose within a warm portafilter) is supposed to result in additional oils being released in the extraction, which in theory leads to a fuller pull and more crema. It's also supposed to add to the benefits of pre-infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have experimented at length with this, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/137/does-pre-heating-a-puck-on-the-group-head-produce-more-crema&quot;&gt;can detect positively no difference between a shot extracted from a cold filter, and one extracted from a warmed one&lt;/a&gt;. It might only be noticeable on higher-end (larger) machines, or simply larger filters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, it's a sound enough practice as it would help keep the group head and portafilter from warping independently, even ever so slightly. Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experiments in various presses, and the amount of crema they produce have shown that pre-warming &lt;em&gt;metal&lt;/em&gt; filters produces more crema. This eluded me because I own a pretty good machine that heats the filter quickly after it has been attached to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy would depend on your machine. The result &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be more crema, and everything that a fuller extraction entails. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suggestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try it on your machine and see if it makes a detectable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It is called ISSpresso and is the&#xA;brainchild of two Italian companies — Argotec and Lavazza — in&#xA;collaboration with the Italian Space Agency&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turin, 13 June 2014 – “An espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard&#xA;the International Space Station.” We have repeatedly heard this&#xA;comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at&#xA;times working in the International Space Station, and today their&#xA;espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza&#xA;are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually&#xA;bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space&#xA;Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of&#xA;the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian&#xA;astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha&#xA;Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into&#xA;space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic&#xA;Italian espresso in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its name is ISSpresso.&lt;/strong&gt; It takes its name from the International Space&#xA;Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first&#xA;capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions&#xA;of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of&#xA;liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.&#xA;ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian&#xA;engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and&#xA;European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for&#xA;in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.&#xA;ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to&#xA;deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it&#xA;was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in&#xA;the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the&#xA;Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects&#xA;and activities to be carried out in the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments &lt;strong&gt;Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President&#xA;of Lavazza&lt;/strong&gt; — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into&#xA;space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xA;the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xA;Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xA;time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xA;just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xA;overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xA;indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xA;International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xA;project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xA;division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xA;and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xA;nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Our aerospace engineers — stated &lt;strong&gt;David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;— have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xA;astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xA;thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xA;systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xA;Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xA;high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xA;with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xA;challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xA;Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xA;In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xA;the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xA;important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xA;espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xA;especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xA;home.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;“ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xA;national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xA;initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xA;technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xA;ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xA;with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xA;improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xA;astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xA;exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to&#xA;contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the&#xA;Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A coffee break in space.&lt;/strong&gt; A prototype of the space coffee machine is&#xA;currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary&#xA;functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –&#xA;Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at&#xA;launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of&#xA;whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner&#xA;café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xA;a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xA;chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xA;missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xA;very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xA;be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xA;or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xA;also be rehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-terrestrial technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Every tiniest detail&#xA;of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xA;challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xA;physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xA;handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xA;environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xA;inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xA;steel tube &lt;strong&gt;designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.&lt;/strong&gt; The&#xA;machine is so complex that it weighs &lt;strong&gt;about 20 kilograms since there&#xA;are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xA;accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xA;Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xA;which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xA;menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xA;dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xA;have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xA;future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Just found images on The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A higher pressure is fine, as long as it is a controlled variable. You may have to tamp harder or start with a finer grind in order to accommodate the higher pressure. The increase in pressure otherwise would cause a faster brewing time and ergo underextraction of the coffee puck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's important is that you keep your pressure consistent. An &lt;em&gt;occasional&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;erratic&lt;/em&gt; bout of high pressure makes your yield unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;First I want to draw a comparison between how much caffeine is in a coffee bean versus a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or a double espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a standard cup of coffee, there is approximately 150 mg of caffeine. In a cup of black tea, steeped for 3 - 5 minutes there is approximately 50 mg of caffeine. In a double espresso there is approximately 60 - 90 mg of caffeine depending on the roast, grind, extraction time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one dark roasted espresso bean there is approximately 6 mg of caffeine according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a person is &lt;strong&gt;extremely sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; to caffeine, they would probably be able to feel the effect of 6 mg of caffeine. However, if someone is a coffee drinker, the likelihood that this caffeine is actually affecting them is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your friend never ingests soda, coffee, tea, or caffeine in any form then he &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; have felt some of the effects. In my opinion, the majority of the way your colleague was feeling was probably a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Coming back to this answer, I neglected to mention the effect of the taste of the coffee bean. Taste and aroma can powerfully affect and stimulate the brain.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to three questions:&#xA;1) Yield = How much did you get from the grounds?&#xA;2) Strength = How much ended up in the cup?&#xA;3) Ratio = What did you get there?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yield: Yield pertains to how much soluble you took from the coffee grounds. Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the assistance of common men like me,&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjtoe.gif&quot; alt=&quot;YEAHAHAHA!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

There are a few reasons why it is beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;used grounds are fairly pH neutral. If your compost is too acidic they even help a little by absorbing extra acid. Unused grounds however would add to acidity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;coffee grounds are considered &quot;green material&quot; in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile. When I empty my indoor compost bin into the outside bin coffee is generally 10-25% of that green material.

Most coffee plants need little sunlight to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes 10 minutes of frost/3 hours of direct sunlight outside from May and November will kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place it near or at the east-facing window to get a good morning sun and just enough sunlight from the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use warm water but don't flood the pots with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making the drinkable coffee will the hard part I guess. Here is a seemingly a good website for roasting at home: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.breworganic.com/coffee/howtoroast.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Roasting at Home&lt;/a&gt;.

You'll also want to make sure you're dripping&#xA;  into a large enough vessel. If you're the more precise-measurement&#xA;  type, a good coffee-to-water ratio is between 60-70 grams of coffee&#xA;  per liter of water (a mass ratio between 1:16 and 1:14.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready.

I like about 207°F for medium to&#xA;  light roasts, and about 10° lower for dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your clock and add enough water to soak all of the coffee (a little premature dripping is okay). Wait for the coffee bed to stop&#xA;  the initial swelling (about 30 seconds) before adding more water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continue your brew. Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to&#xA;  your target brew time (see below). The distance that your brew water&#xA;  drops can affect brew temperatures, as well as increase or decrease&#xA;  the amount of agitation that the falling water creates wherever it&#xA;  falls in the coffee bed. In general, the lower you pour from, the&#xA;  better, if for no other reason than it's the easiest to create and&#xA;  maintain consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When you stop adding water, your dripper will continue to drip for&#xA;  between 20 and 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Your target total brew time is about 2.5 to 3 minutes for dark roasted&#xA;  coffee, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium to light roasted coffees.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Sorting done during the processing phase of coffee production (prior to roasting) is done in many places and can produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/264/peaberry-and-coffee-varieties&quot;&gt;lots of coffee that look very different, but taste almost exactly the same.&lt;/a&gt;  Peaberry beans may be sorted out (mostly by sight from what I understand) and sold as separate lots.  Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly &quot;bad&quot; beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I roast at home and the only time I have ever &quot;sorted&quot; is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Also, you want your steam wand to just be plain and simple and not have one of those 'frothing helpers' for beginners. Most come with it but are removable.

Almost no one does this as it tastes horrible, but my grandma actually used to eat the grounds at the bottom with some sugar, so I guess exceptions exist... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

After performing the gross behavioral study, the&#xA;  Antibacterial activity was evaluated against Gram&#xA;  - negative bacteria included; Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Both compounds at a&#xA;  concentration of 2 mg/ml showed similar anti bacterial activities&#xA;  against all tested bacteria, except for P. mirabilis , and the highest&#xA;  inhibitory effect was observed against P. aeruginosa using a modified&#xA;  agar diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of&#xA;  caffeine was determined us ing a broth microdilution method in 96&#xA;  multi&#xA;  - well microtitre plates. MIC values ranged from 65.5 to&#xA;  250.0 μ g/ml for the caffeine isolated from coffee and 65.5 to 500.0 μ g/ml for green tea caffeine. Combination results showed additive&#xA;  effects against most p athogenic bacteria especially for P.&#xA;  aeruginosa, using both antibacterial assays.

In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, it says that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Place the pot over a low flame. A low flame increases the brew time, which enhances the flavor. At a later step, you’ll want a slow trickle of espresso instead of a full-force fountain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You would want a nice, long brew time. The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat. To answer that question, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;YES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it is a great idea to turn down the heat. &lt;strong&gt;EXTRA&lt;/strong&gt;: The site also shows how to make a nice moka (not spam)! Second, you really answered your last question yourself. Low heat is better than high heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm going to answer your second question. Looks like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beverage/MokaEspressoPot.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; uses Italian pots just like your induction hob. For stovetop pots and not stovepot pots, it says that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When the water in the tank has been exhausted, that's when you hear the ‘gurgle’ that signifies the drink is ready to pour (approximately 4 to 5 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like 4 to 5 minutes is just the right time for the coffee to be ready for extraction here. You should know the sound of someone using mouthwash and gurgling. The coffee pot will start to produce that sound when coffee is ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I will answer your first question. I can't seem to find any significant information on your question, so I'll take a shot at it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Supposedly, it might be your decision. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe some people like this setting while others like another. I don't know what your standards for a good brew is so I'll just say that you should choose it. Sorry for the lack of information! I hope this answer answered all your questions!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be &lt;strong&gt;oxidation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Oxidation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons&#xA;  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different&#xA;  compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates&#xA;  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)&#xA;  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss of heat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering your final question about duration of freshness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. &lt;strong&gt;The sooner you drink it the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.&lt;/strong&gt; You might also look into cold brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Black Bear Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Basically the way it works is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a load of volunteers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Track them over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt;, only for &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember also that medical studies are &lt;em&gt;chronically&lt;/em&gt; badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One tool against all of this uncertainty is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;One of these was done&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Heterogeneous is science for 'different')&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i.e., &amp;quot;Not sure yet, not enough data, but it looks promising, give us more money for research.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

You may get cheaper robusta beans, or a mix. You will get older, staler beans. You will get the poor end of the harvest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, go above that price and you're needlessly spending extra cash. You're now spending on marketing for the people you're buying it from. You're paying for a fancier bag, better branding etc. This may actually make it taste bette - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0148296382900418&quot;&gt;psychology is a powerful thing&lt;/a&gt;, but the beans you're getting won't be significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, this magic price-point is impossible to find, fluctuates wildly, and it's in the interests of suppliers to obfusticate it as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to try a variety of coffees that you can afford and find one you like. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Cold brew is simply brewing coffee in cold water.  It's usually a long process (about 12 hours), but totally worth it.  The simplest method is using a french press.  Measure the amount of coffee and water you need for a regular hot french press brew, but instead use cold or room temperature water.  Leave the press pot in a refrigerator overnight or at room temperature, push the plunger down in the morning, and you'll have delicious cold brew ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also buy cold brew systems.  I've never used it, but I heard this works pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006H0JVW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Toddy T2N Cold Brew System &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Assuming the perfect grind, you are looking for extraction time and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ideal double shot should be &lt;strong&gt;60 mL&lt;/strong&gt; (about 2 US fluid ounces) and should be extracted between &lt;strong&gt;20-30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use the double shot as the example because it is considered to be the standard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So essentially, pull a double shot until 60 mL or 2 ounces comes out. You can use something to measure this volume like a graduated shot glass. Time how long this takes. I always aim for 20 seconds. If it is faster than 20 seconds, then you need to make your grind slightly finer. If it is slower than this, then you need to make the grind slightly coarser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then modify to your taste! If you like the way it tastes when it takes 30 seconds, then drink away and enjoy. If you prefer 20 seconds, then enjoy that!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Half these values for a single shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people will argue that a double shot should be 40 mL and not 60 mL.

Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;).

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: this &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.meta.stackexchange.com/q/60/262&quot;&gt;meta question&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.meta.stackexchange.com/a/74/262&quot;&gt;my answer&lt;/a&gt; prompted this adaptation as a clarification question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

And the last cup in the pitcher is much stronger than it used to be, but I'm not exactly complaining about that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also go for an intermediate approach, using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_strainer&quot;&gt;tea strainer&lt;/a&gt; before you run the brew through a regular filter: that'll get the big stuff out fast so your filtering doesn't slow down. (Also, put a teaspoon in the funnel under the filter, so the grounds don't stick to the sides of the funnel through the paper. It gives the liquid more room to flow.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's not really the pressure, that's just timing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It depends on the beans and roast; your comparison point is the first few (after pre-infusion) drips that came out. The last ones are always going to be weaker and quite possibly more acidic because the puck is both drained and saturated at the same time. It's drained of oils and flavors, and saturated with hot water. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you can actually &lt;em&gt;detect&lt;/em&gt; that difference should it be added to the rest of the shot is a matter of uncertainty, hinging on your sense of taste and the type of coffee used. If it's a dark-roasted robusta blend then you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to detect a slight almost 'metallic' or slightly salty flavor, but you'd need an extremely acute sense of taste. The water you use also has a lot to do with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes be easy to get caught up in what is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; happening, even if you (or most) can't really taste it. If you get more satisfaction out of your coffee because you've managed to improve the taste &lt;em&gt;even just a tiny bit&lt;/em&gt; - then great, and keep doing it, because that's what it's all about. Just be critical and test for yourself, with your setup, and your beans :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Recipes vary according to taste, but if you want a similar concentration (&quot;strength&quot;) of coffee, you'll probably want to use a stronger brew of coffee (basically amounts to using more grounds). This is because you're diluting the coffee when you add the ice (which melts), even more so if you're trying to start with freshly brewed and very hot coffee (melting more ice). Here's a suggestion from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chow.com/recipes/30487-basic-cold-brewed-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chow&lt;/a&gt; and a discussion from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/whats-the-best-way-to-brew-iced-coffee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; that discuss the methods. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, though, I prefer the result of cold-brewed coffee. Rather than brewed-hot and served-cold, it's both brewed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; served cold. I think the cold-brew extraction is a better complement to the cold service. Furthermore, less ice might be needed to cool the beverage to a similar temperature, which is an added bonus. See the myriad questions with &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/cold-brew&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'cold-brew'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; for more on that subject. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for milk/cream and/or sugar/sweetener, this seems to be entirely personal preference.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My take on this is to focus on the mechanics and preparation, which I think is an important part (though perhaps not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;) of a cappuccino being properly made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino#Preparation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cappuccino&lt;/a&gt; consists of espresso and steamed milk (see distinction from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;latte&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World Barista Championship&lt;/a&gt; specifies the proper construction in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;beverage definitions (.PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the &lt;strong&gt;components&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;volume&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;amount of foam&lt;/strong&gt; define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in &quot;harmonious balance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;visual appearance&lt;/strong&gt;, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;served with accoutrements&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &quot;spoon, napkin and unflavoured water&quot;;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;logistical aspects&lt;/strong&gt; of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being &quot;wet&quot; (referring to the foam, versus &quot;dry&quot;), and &quot;traditional&quot; (solid central circle of white foam, versus having &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;latte art&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffee-how-to/how-to-videos/cappuccino&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Folgers suggests&lt;/a&gt; to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam.

The end result of that was in consistence and taste not much different from classic (drip, so to say) coffee, but had a notable and interesting by-taste of egg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was quite bit unusual to me and I didn't ever encounter this recipe again (yet am not an expert on the topic either). So I would first and foremost like to know if that preparation method is some kind of established or regional variation of coffee and how that actually developed or what the reasons/advantages for this somehow unusual combination are, be they nutritional, historical or just because it tastes good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Of course I also found an article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://puttingweirdthingsincoffee.com/2010/01/28/putting-an-egg-in-coffee-eggspresso/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Putting Weird Things In Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, which should be taken with a pinch of salt&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a variety of approaches, but they seem to fall into three main camps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add just the white and the shell&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add just the &lt;em&gt;yolk&lt;/em&gt; and the shell&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the whole egg, including the shell&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Across the different techniques, adding the shell was the only real unifying theme! It's said to reduce bitterness (I imagine because the shell is essentially calcium-carbonate, which is basic). The technique is to just crush up the shell, mix it and the egg contents with the coffee and pour over boiling water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grounds will bind with the egg protein and sink in the cup. They can then be strained off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only other recipe I found is specifically for Vietnamese egg coffee, which I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legalnomads.com/2013/01/vietnamese-egg-coffee-recipe.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3 teaspoons of Vietnamese coffee powder&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Boiling water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew a small cup of Vietnamese coffee.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think &lt;strong&gt;you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew&lt;/strong&gt; (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262&quot;&gt;this question about coffee going stale&lt;/a&gt; -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262&quot;&gt;this question about what's happening&lt;/a&gt; with stale coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long&lt;/strong&gt; as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286&quot;&gt;this question/answer on Cooking.SE&lt;/a&gt; recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are many difference between the two filters. In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baltcoffee.com/content/whats-difference-between-brown-filters-and-white-filters&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. it states that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Speaking of Performance...&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;,it states that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Taste&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;amp;t=833&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where all the information of this section came from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Environmental Impacts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-using-coffee-filters-7625.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that provided the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I suppose flavor won't be changed. Most coffee beans are grown &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;just like that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeehunter.com/articles/shade_grown_coffee_agronomist%E2%80%99s_perspective&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too much shade will cause fungal infections&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html&quot;&gt;the use of &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; saucers&lt;/a&gt; for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm&quot;&gt;according to US government legend&lt;/a&gt;, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html&quot;&gt;eating peas off the back of one's fork&lt;/a&gt;. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.  Other discussion forums (&lt;a href=&quot;http://aforum.genealogi.se/discus/messages/2450/91396.html?1269309231&quot;&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt;) contain some additional anecdotes and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshcup.com/brewing-turkish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moka pot. The size of the pot determines how much you brew at a time; can't really make more or less (though you &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1519/how-should-i-make-multiple-batches-quickly-with-a-moka-pot&quot;&gt;could brew a few pots in a row&lt;/a&gt;).

That article says &lt;em&gt;rinsing removes &quot;dusty stuff&quot;&lt;/em&gt; from the filter (that suggests that there's off-tastes from the paper dust), and rinsing also &lt;em&gt;helps reduce clogging&lt;/em&gt; of filter pores (presumably also from the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the paper filter certainly matters; comments and responses to &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; support that.

(&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; to be clear, I chewed on these filters only to see if I taste a difference between rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to somehow &quot;condition&quot; the filter before brewing use)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper filters taste terrible&lt;/strong&gt; -- mine anyway -- rinsed or not. I may have to revisit &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question on brown versus white filters&lt;/a&gt;, buy better paper filters, or use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/434/how-does-nel-drip-compare-to-paper-filtered-pour-over&quot;&gt;cloth-filtered Nel pot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wasted a lot of filters doing these tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, after using a pre-rinsed filter I got a &quot;structural failure&quot; -- the bottom of the filter broke -- when brewing pour-over with a heavily rinsed filter. I'll probably have to eat some better-quality or white paper filters to make this fair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In sum, my only conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;quickly rinsing the inside &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; outside&lt;/strong&gt; of the filter is the only way for this to have any benefit. I'm discounting any other benefit of pre-rinsing, such as rinsing with hot water would warm ceramic cone filter-holder or pot/mug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Let's answer your first question first:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's the best way to rinse a paper filter? Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't really rinse &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's answer your second question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &amp;quot;keeping&amp;quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is being rinsed off?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &amp;quot;dusty stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

However, certain roasts are more common or &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; taste better with certain preparations (cf., &quot;espresso roast&quot; or so).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How about for cold brew? Aside from personal preference, &lt;strong&gt;is there something about cold brew that lends itself to better extraction with a certain roast level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;a medium roast is recommended&lt;/strong&gt; in both &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the cold-brew guide from Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the guide from Kicking Horse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As noted in the Kicking Horse link above, cold brew will generally produce a lower-acid result (i.e., than the same coffee prepared by other methods). Generally speaking, lighter roasts will have &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; acid content. The combination of these two seems to suggest (to me, anyway) to the conclusion that one can use lighter roasts for cold brew (i.e., lighter than you might otherwise enjoy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a good reason to use medium (or lighter roasts) with cold-brew?&lt;/strong&gt; Or, alternatively: &lt;strong&gt;Is there some reason to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use dark roasts with cold-brew?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm going to answer this in terms of flavor, and then acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, people choose more lightly roasted coffee to preserve the terroir flavors of the bean. These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.&lt;/strong&gt; Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a French press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.&lt;/strong&gt; Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew. As backwards as it is, I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered &quot;over-extracted&quot; and can be bitter&lt;/strong&gt;, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These figures were generated by groups with lofty-sounding names like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_Coffee_Association_of_America&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Specialty Coffee Association of America&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scaa.org/chronicle/2013/10/04/the-coffee-brewing-institute/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Brewing Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Italian Espresso National Institute&lt;/a&gt;.

Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Permanent versus Paper filters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Drip Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat-bottom filters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flat-bottom Filter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cone shaped filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cone shaped filter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRrn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hybrid cone filter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Single Cup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;French (Push) Press&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Parts of a French Press Filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xrAHF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;French Press Filter Parts&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Espresso Machine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portafilters (single wall) on left and baskets (which hold them and are upside down) on the right:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeKtK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Portafilters&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The filter on the left is a single shot and the filter on the right is a double shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Permanent filters win on cost over time. Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  &lt;strong&gt;My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[1] pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;pro/con overview from air-n-water&lt;/a&gt; (obscure?);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;World of Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[3] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;LiveStrong&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[4] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt;, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written &lt;em&gt;a lot of text&lt;/em&gt; here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper versus metal mesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262&quot;&gt;cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time&quot;&gt;how often and how much to clean a permanent filter&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinse your paper filters&lt;/a&gt;, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; For my money, personally, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer the paper filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

There are several capsule-based espresso machines (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here's a review of Nespresso and three others&lt;/a&gt;). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &amp;quot;pod&amp;quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;No.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In simple point of fact, &lt;strong&gt;espresso is not &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; made with a coffee-filled capsule&lt;/strong&gt;, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;INEI&lt;/a&gt; being a benchmark of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;espresso production standards (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone&lt;/strong&gt;, with regard to &amp;quot;Certified Italian Espresso&amp;quot; at least. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;quantity of coffee (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nespresso might be light&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure&quot;&gt;using pressure that is too high&lt;/a&gt;, or on the other hand &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262&quot;&gt;too low&lt;/a&gt; for extraction and crema. That said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;it seems that AeroPress can create crema&lt;/a&gt; at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maybe.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &amp;quot;legitimacy&amp;quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. &lt;a href=&quot;http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;One four-subject test&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;em&gt;higher marks&lt;/em&gt; to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; agrees. Another test disagreed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;It doesn't matter.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), &lt;strong&gt;what difference does it make if it's &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;real&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; espresso or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not (and @Chris in AK agreed and notes &amp;quot;Aerpresso&amp;quot; in comments!), but that's a separate question also...&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Coffee that's packaged immediately after roasting will give off a bit in the bag, hence the need for a valve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxygen causes coffee to go off, which is why we keep our coffee in airtight containers to preserve it as long as possible. It's why the valve on the bag is designed to prevent air from the outside getting in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The CO2 that's accumulating in the bags is essentially inert, and won't cause the coffee beans to go off.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a number of concrete factors that will impact the stimulation you get from a cup of coffee, but it probably boils down to &lt;strong&gt;the amount of caffeine (and any other stimulants) that are in your cup&lt;/strong&gt; that get extracted from the beans.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;practice!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; And... The most optimal way of &lt;strong&gt;tamping depends on every individual pull&lt;/strong&gt;: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to &lt;strong&gt;pack the grounds uniformly.&lt;/strong&gt; Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a &quot;slanted&quot; puck; if your grounds are packed &lt;em&gt;more loosely&lt;/em&gt; in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this &quot;by feel&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for &quot;polishing&quot;, but not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's some controversial bits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Knocking&quot; is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the &quot;North, South, West, East&quot; topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few articles on different takes on tamping: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualcoffee.com/jun/perfect.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I Need Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/coffeeatthemoment/10-07-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The roasting chamber of your Gene Cafe is &lt;strong&gt;made of Pyrex&lt;/strong&gt; (heat-resistant tempered glass), and leaving the old oils to accumulate and burn will cause the the inside of the drum to turn black. The darker material will likely change your roasting time, and the fouled glass will not allow you to monitor your roasts. &lt;strong&gt;Glass does not need &quot;seasoning&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, so it should be cleaned regularly per the manufacturer's recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seasoning&lt;/em&gt; is typically a way to create a stick-resistant coating on a &lt;em&gt;porous&lt;/em&gt; metal surface (like cast iron or carbon steel). When a thin layer of fat or oil is heated on these surfaces, it forms a polymer which provides rust protection and creates a non-stick surface that will keep whatever you are cooking/roasting from reacting with the cooking surface (the &lt;em&gt;juju&lt;/em&gt; you mentioned above). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the roasting chamber were made of cast iron or carbon steel, seasoning would be recommended. But neither glass nor stainless steel need seasoning, and you're just changing the built-in characteristics of your roaster. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep your roaster in optimal roasting condition, keep your glass roasting chamber clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you only use a double (14g) portafilter basket then you're best to use a 58mm convex tamper. This is because if you look at the basket, in most cases, the sides will slope in. Therefore, if you had a flat 58mm tamper then the you are compressing to outer more than the inner. Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best. If you want to use a flat tamper for any reason in this situation, you would be best using a 57mm flat tamper and tap the edge of the portafilter to knock any loose grounds back down into the basket and then rotate the tamper over to produce a flat surface for the water to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, however, you are using a single (7g) portafilter basket then the 58mm tamper would probably be too wide to compress the grounds evenly as it may not go far enough down in the portafilter basket to tamp it at all. Therefore, you would be best using a 57mm tamper. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're using a triple basket then a 58mm convex rules would apply the same as the double basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all based on the assumption that the basket is 58mm. This is the most common size but other sizes do crop up, commonly on older machines which may use a 53mm basket. In this case the flat/convex rules still apply, just with the smaller diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The crema definitely affects the initial taste of the coffee, that's where the concentrated notes of whatever bean you're using is going to be found. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I make a long black by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pour 3/4 cup of hot water (right from the machine)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wait 2 - 3 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pull a double shot into it, holding it &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; under the group to minimize splashing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let sit for about 30 seconds, serve&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, I make an Americano by just pulling a double shot into a cup while also taking care to minimize splashing, then I serve it with a small steel or ceramic carafe of hot water (everyone likes a little more or a little less than everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both instances, I heat the cup, and that's important because the crema will quickly break up on the walls of the cup if you don't. Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; hit the caramel notes more, in my experience. But, I usually just make myself an Americano because it's easier and the taste isn't all &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Done at home using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-barista-expresstm.html&quot;&gt;Breville Barista Express&lt;/a&gt; in manual mode. You don't really need a super expensive machine to replicate this, you just need the ability to pre-infuse, warm the cup, and be able to wrangle one under the group to minimize splashing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concluding, I think there's some substance to this. However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day. It took close to a dozen tries to finally get a process down where the taste was noticeable and I could reliably reproduce it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you order either at your average coffee shop, I don't know that you'd be able to tell the difference, I never have. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Since decaf coffee isn't the same as caffeine-free coffee, the key point regarding addiction is the amount of daily servings of decaf coffee that deliver the 100 milligrams of caffeine needed to acquire some sort of dependence &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0119_050119_ngm_caffeine.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The amount of such cups of decaf will vary according to the brand chosen. According to a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Analytical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;, and cited in the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/diet/20061011/decaf-coffee-isnt-caffeine-free&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Decaf coffee isn't caffeine free&lt;/a&gt;, they say that in average, a cup of decaf can hold about one-twentieth of the caffeine you get in a normal drip brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that same article, they state that drinking more cups of decaf can compensate the lack of caffeine, and still be able to produce addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it is indeed a matter of how many cups of decaf you drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="What influence do the dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have on the drinking experience?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;At work I usually drink coffee (multiple times daily) from a metallic cup which I actually never ever wash on the inside. This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am however wondering &lt;strong&gt;if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup&lt;/strong&gt;. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the &lt;strong&gt;dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You're actually asking two different questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;) flavor component to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between &lt;em&gt;&quot;100% fresh&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&quot;Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of &lt;em&gt;soap&lt;/em&gt; on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily &lt;em&gt;tasted&lt;/em&gt; if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still &lt;em&gt;essentially&lt;/em&gt; coffee (somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of &quot;a few drops&quot; of &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; effect on taste. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely &lt;em&gt;stainless&lt;/em&gt;, so you are not likely building up any patina&amp;hellip; so you are essentially &quot;washing away&quot; the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee. There should be no substantial, cumulative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Research funding for health benefits by coffee trade associations"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;How much funding is provided by the coffee industry for research on the health benefits of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came across a statistic that surprised me by its meagerness.  According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150323060240/http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=880&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;, the National Coffee Association USA has spent $6 million on research funding over the last 20 or so years.  The NCAUSA cites 80 specific investigations that they funded. (I don't know if the trend is up or down over the two decades.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From reading Antony Wild's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/coffee-antony-wild/1112483551?ean=9780393060713&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee: A Dark History&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, it was my impression that the coffee industry sets great importance on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/health/coffee-myth-fact/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;demonstrable health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. See in particular Chapt. 14, Coffee, Science and History.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book mentions specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanderbilt.edu/ics/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vanderbilt Institute for Coffee Studies&lt;/a&gt; as funded by &quot;a $6 million grant from the coffee industry&quot; to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 1999.  (In 2007 the Institute moved its affiliation from the Medical Center to the Vanderbilt Center for Latin American Studies, but continues investigating &quot;the health effects of coffee consumption, including potential therapeutic uses&quot;.)  While some of this funding came from NCAUSA, it appears the bulk came from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), with additional funding by the All Japan Coffee Association and the International Coffee Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The global coffee commodity market has annual sales &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=|||||0901|||4|1|1|2|2|1|2|1|&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;well-up in the tens of billions($)&lt;/a&gt;, so I would expect more in annual research funding than the average $300K/yr reported by NCAUSA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added:&lt;/strong&gt; Apparently it is difficult for coffee trade associations to survive.  The NCAUSA cited above is ancient in comparison to other organizations mentioned.  The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/business/world-markets-a-new-coffee-cartel-tries-its-hand.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;began in 1993&lt;/a&gt; with a model of OPEC-like price supports through agreed upon limitations of exports, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1608356.stm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;dissolved at the beginning of 2002&lt;/a&gt;.

    <Title Title="How does sugar influence the taste?"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar adds a sweet taste to coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; not a sour taste.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Sourness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sourness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;sweetness&lt;/a&gt; are rather separate &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tastes&lt;/a&gt;! Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sourness&lt;/em&gt; is a perception of &lt;em&gt;acidity&lt;/em&gt;. In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;cola&lt;/a&gt; has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17395/why-does-adding-sugar-to-sour-things-cause-them-not-to-be-sour&quot;&gt;this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness&lt;/a&gt;). I don't see how sugar could be &lt;em&gt;the cause&lt;/em&gt; of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). &lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; That said, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; the perception of sourness, but it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) &lt;em&gt;dissipates more quickly&lt;/em&gt; than the sourness (acids), you might be left with &quot;more sourness than sweetness&quot; in the &lt;em&gt;aftertaste&lt;/em&gt; after some time. That is, you're left with &quot;un-maksked&quot; residual sourness which, though present all along, is more &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweetness&lt;/em&gt; is perceived by the presence of &lt;em&gt;sugar&lt;/em&gt; (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt;).

If you don't happen to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intsocderm.org&quot;&gt;International Journal of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; you can obtain the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03119.x/epdf&quot;&gt;PDF of this article&lt;/a&gt; for perhaps a small fee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't know if this has been demonstrated in any clinical trials.&lt;/strong&gt; I can't find any longitudinal studies of longer-term effectiveness, nor can I find any evidence of actual clinical trials.

You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Use the same water you use for drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[4] Known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html&quot;&gt;Ross Droplet Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Tannin is a chemical contained in coffee and this is what normally stains your coffee making / drinking equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When using an espresso machine it is advised to 'backflush' your machine with cleaning powder which cleans away a build up of 'tannin' from inside the machine. I expect a similar thing has happened to your carafe.

If you fix all but one variable, you'd have an answer for any given equation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these things are ultimately affecting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;solubility&lt;/a&gt; of the caffeine in the coffee.  Since espresso is one of the few brewing methods to affect pressure (and generally uses the greatest pressure) it's going to be the winner.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-40422008000600009&amp;amp;script=sci_arttext&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Increased pressure means increased caffeine solubility.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From wikipedia you'll note the two major factors affecting solubility are temperature and pressure.  You'll also note that dissolution doesn't always happen instantly; rates may vary based on conditions.

Any smell you get from the cup could affect the perception of taste of the contained beverage. If the cup has a plastic lid, that could contribute both to its own smell, or holding-in / reducing the coffee aroma that you smell, also. (Aside: there are some interesting links to the physiology of smell and taste interplay at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on taste&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The very experience of drinking from a paper cup versus a ceramic cup is different&lt;/strong&gt;; heft, shape, handle, other aesthetics, etc., though this probably reduces to personal preference.  For example, I find sometimes that my lip sticks to the outside of the paper cup, which is unpleasant (to me, anyway :).

For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists&quot;&gt;temperature can affect the perception of bitterness&lt;/a&gt;. A properly pre-heated ceramic cup/demitasse will help the brewed coffee be at a consistent temperature (without shocking it after pull) and keep it warmer for longer (so it doesn't cool down too quickly). Such temperature changes could result in a difference in taste; &lt;strong&gt;keeping brewed coffee at a consistent temperature is recommended&lt;/strong&gt; -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/1thebasics.html&quot;&gt;that and some other general properties are listed here&lt;/a&gt;.

As for the health benefits, almond milk has good proteins, calcium and Vitamin D, low sugar as long it is unsweetened. It is rather hard to  make latte art or steam as well for a perfect cup. Also it is hard to make a good cappuccino with this type of milk. If going for health, not taste or looks, go for almond milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Soy&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An excellent substitute for your lactose milk. It compliments coffee very well and is very delicious when put in coffee. It creates a great foam and is easier to have be steamed. It has been criticized though for many different reasons. If you are allergic to diary, never use soy milk or any milk at all really. Soy milk can match the consistency and texture of a good cup of coffee. Soy milk is a forgiving milk that goes with many types of coffee. But it does have a lot of sugar though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Hemp&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is similar to soy milk when it comes to steaming and being a favorite substitute for regular milk. Given that it is very easy to make at home, it provides lots of minerals you need such as 46 percent of your daily calcium and about 900 mg of Omega-3. These &amp;quot;resources&amp;quot; are to come by for vegans and vegetarians, so drink up! It has a creamier taste like soy milk and a flavor similar to almond milk, the best combo!

It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help &quot;wick&quot; the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting the two types of cones:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the &quot;wells&quot; from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow &quot;seals&quot; itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for &quot;why&quot; this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the &quot;seal&quot; and permits the coffee to drain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar &quot;ridge&quot; that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little &quot;pleats&quot; in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that this &quot;pooling&quot; happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the &quot;sealing,&quot; but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide&lt;/a&gt; suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you could be more specific with your question it would be easier to answer.  For example was your previous &quot;pot&quot; a percolator or automatic coffee maker or what?  By the same token, what is your current set up?  By a process of elimination you should be able to isolate the factor that's causing your coffee to taste sh***ty.  Basically those are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The coffee itself - is it from the same source, being stored the same, same age, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Same water - you said you'd tried different water sources.  Bottled water should yield good coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The method of brewing, which would include water temperature, coarseness of grind, how long it extracts (steeps), cleanliness of the equipment, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all the factors except the method of brewing are accounted for, then the problem is in the brewing method, which would include the coffee maker.  If you know it's clean and it still tastes bad, you need a different brewing method.  Depending on how much coffee you drink, there are lots of options that will yield good coffee.  I have found that the simpler methods (i.e., French press, AeroPress, pour over) are the easiest to control and therefore give you the best chance of getting a good result.  They are also cheaper and easier to keep clean.  Brewing good coffee is actually pretty straightforward so don't give up!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's going to produce a stronger brew and probably more oils, likely resulting in more crema.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you're essentially doing is heating the grinds, starting the extraction process a bit and then giving a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; amount of hot water about 30 seconds to cool before adding more - very similar to what pre-infusing a puck in an espresso machine would accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does it matter? It could conceivably affect taste, so yes. The extent that it might affect the flavor of the coffee would vary quite a bit depending on the beans, water and ground - but it will produce a difference in taste you can probably measure just by sampling in all but very dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For gas levels - you would have to pour very carefully to avoid air bubbles as much as possible and observe, and I'm not even sure you could detect it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

After two batches so far, the first, done according to the directions, was horribly undrinkable, and the second, while drinkable still wasn't very good.  The flavor is a somewhat bitter aftertaste.

But that still leaves the question of how much heat and how to adjust that during the roast. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are there any straightforward principles for how to adjust the roast in respone to the taste I've gotten from my first attempts?  Or any guidance on differences in roasting light vs Full City which would be the darkest I would do?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really don't want to reinvent the wheel here and waste a bunch of coffee beans in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

You need to try to finish your roast at a level or so lighter than what you are aiming for and let the coffee &quot;cool&quot; into your desired roast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might suggest that you roast at a lower level (lower heat) so that the beans move through the stages more slowly.  This will badly suck up your time, but will also allow you greater chance of stopping the roast at the roast level you are aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that many of the descriptions you read for green coffee are done by people with extremely refined palates.  No matter what coffee you roast, those fruit type descriptions are still hints and notes in the coffee, not it's overall flavor.  Additionally the quality of the green beans you are roasting will affect the final quality of your roast. It's impossible to make poor green beans great by perfectly roasting them.  You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started roasting, I was &quot;lucky&quot; enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the &quot;cracks&quot; associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the &quot;cracks&quot; are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level. While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell), they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other cues that it didn't matter as much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This would also explain why the base of the rosetta is a bit &quot;murky&quot;. That took me a while to figure out, but I had the same issue (check &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/i3JPUrlnjm/?taken-by=stanimiroff&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out, then compare to &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/0SNJKLFnuR/?taken-by=stanimiroff&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). So in practical terms, avoid wiggling the pitcher before a white &quot;dot&quot; appears on the surface. Only once the white dot appears on the surface and the stream of milk coming from the pitcher has pushed it further into the cup, should you start rocking the pitcher left to right (good example&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/0Ar4bWgYos/?taken-by=_chris_mg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; albeit a different pattern).

Thus explains the cost of components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example BOM for  coffee Maker&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Serviceability and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It is important to have in mind that altitude is not the only feature that allows one to differentiate the coffee beans. Temperature is perhaps even more important (altitude influences in the temperatures suffered by a coffee plant, but not all the same altitudes mean the same temperature profiles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a brief summary (taken from &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;), we can say that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lower elevations (Robusta species) mean a more intensely coffee flavoured bean (more caffeine).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Higher elevations (Arabica species) mean more acid and complex taste.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the main factor is the species of coffee. The elevation and temperature only tell you what of the varieties of these species you can successfully grow and how you can harvest it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to this source &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribblerscoffee.com/flavor_effect_of_altitude&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor&lt;/a&gt;, that relates only to the Arabica species, can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Altitude contributes to a coffee taste profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ideal growing conditions for the coffee tree:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the coffee belt (a band extending approximately 30° north and south of equator).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At high elevations, between 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) and 6,000 feet (1828,8 meters) and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These conditions provide a frost-free climate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Averaging 60°F (15.56°C) to 70°F (21.11°C) year round.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cooler mountains provide a slower growth cycle for coffee tree.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This means deeper and more interesting flavours (due to a longer maturation process).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better drainage of soils means less water in the fruit.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Further concentration of flavours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More fertile the soil, the better.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A volcanic soil is often preferred.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The farther we are from the coffee belt, the less elevation we must grow coffee tree in order to avoid low temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a more specific summary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, more elevation implies a more pronounced and distinctive flavour profile:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the simple, mild and subtle of those grown at 2,000 feet (609,6 meters).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To a fruit, spice, floral profile for those grown at 5,000 feet (1524 meters) or above (when possible).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This other source &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bonaverde.com/mag/en/magazine/coffee-4/coffee-guide/production/planting-and-growing-coffe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bean Basics: Planting &amp;amp; Growing Coffee&lt;/a&gt; deals with how altitude affects the planting and harvesting of coffee tree, not about its features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailycoffeenews.com/2015/04/08/whats-so-important-about-high-altitude-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;What’s So Important About High-Altitude Coffee?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[2]: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribblerscoffee.com/flavor_effect_of_altitude&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[3]: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bonaverde.com/mag/en/magazine/coffee-4/coffee-guide/production/planting-and-growing-coffe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bean Basics: Planting &amp;amp; Growing Coffee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My personal preference is to just add a bit of water to top my cup off.  I do not use the inverted method, and by adding additional water during the brewing (since I tend to get just a bit of drippage during brewing) I tend to end up with pretty close to a full cup.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if you are looking for a much stronger (pseudo espresso) cup, the second method may be for you.  It has only really the drawback of using an additional sum of coffee and filter.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would not recommend using the 3rd method.  At that point you are just headed to over extracted grounds and a less desirable (by most people) cup of coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, you are looking at producing a cup sized quantity of good coffee with method one, a cup sized quantity of Aerpresso with the second and a cup sized quantity of likely over extracted coffee with method three.  Any of these may be fine depending on what you are trying to achieve.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Normally in a drip coffee machine the 'brew' mode is where the water in the reservoir is boiled/heated and dripped over the ground coffee, before passing through the filter and into the jug. The 'keep warm' part is usually a hot plate under the jug which heats the jug from below, keeping the coffee warm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My drip coffee machine doesn't allow you to switch it to one mode or the other, you just switch it on and it pumps the water through the filter until its empty - there is a floating switch in the bottom so it knows when there is no more water left, and the hot plate is always on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume that your drip coffee machine works in the same way but has separate controls for the brew and keep warm features. Switching the 'keep warm' feature back on isn't going to harm anything - I'd question the quality of the coffee after 2+ hours sitting on a hot plate though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Blooming is the outgassing of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the ground coffee in response to hot water being added.  The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="How to increase your caffeine sensitivity?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have been drinking coffee for a long time and over the last few years I've noticed that my sensitivity to caffeine has dropped significantly. Nowadays, it basically has no effect whatsoever - I can drink double espressos and go to sleep right away and I also don't feel anything after drinking multiples of those. According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity&quot;&gt;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; I guess that I've become hyposensitive to it (probably due to the abuse of all the coffee machines at my workplace)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't always like this - I even used to use it as a preworkout while I was studying (in large quantities, but still). &lt;strong&gt;My question is whether someone has had the same problem and managed to increase their sensitivity. If so, how and how long did it take?&lt;/strong&gt; There are some tricks using grapefruit juice with coffee because of narangin which improves caffeine absorption or using fat (bulletproof coffee) for the same reason &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/&quot;&gt;https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/&lt;/a&gt; (I haven't tried these yet).

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Over the years I developed a caffeine addiction that reached fairly severe levels.  For background, the addiction ramped into high gear the summer after my freshman year of college (summer of '99) when I was consuming somewhere between 60 and 100 ounces of coffee per day.  I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I &lt;strong&gt;slowly&lt;/strong&gt; backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did all this over a six-week period.  That kept the headaches away, and decreased my dependence on the drug.  However, I had to maintain at that level for several more months -- probably about six or so -- for my sensitivity to caffeine to go back up.  Now, when I drink a cup in the morning, it has the desired effect: it perks me up and prepares me for my day.  It's no longer a crutch, it's simply a pick-me-up I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary: back down your caffeine intake, whatever the delivery method you prefer, by 10 to 20 percent each week until you reach a more manageable level, then hold at that level for several months.  That will increase your sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Reusing paper filter by placing metallic net filter in it"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;First, what I do; then, the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to brew coffee one cup at a time. To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)  Obviously, the coffee smells and tastes fine to me, but I have to wonder whether noses and palates that are more sensitive than mine think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know, it says &quot;we prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed&quot;, so if you have something to say, please just state it without starting a long discussion about it!

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I had some Kopi Luwak, in Indonesia. I've read a number of reviews. It's been hard to find blind tastings by coffee experts. Basically, it doesn't seem like anything special. If anything, it kind of tastes bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, there may be more to the story. Indonesians I know have offered two explanations for why I was unimpressed. And these excuses were not mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One is a lack of certification -- that is, how do you know you were drinking real Kopi Luwak? Hah! Maybe somebody's faking you out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other excuse is that, even when it's &quot;real&quot;, it might be factory farmed. This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or so /that/ excuse goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive. Maybe 30% more than anything comparable, when I was there last year. That margin might be narrowing. The cachet of Kopi Luwak being &quot;the world's rarest coffee&quot; apparently become a selling point in Indonesia, but since the barriers to market entry are low (especially since verification is virtually non-existent), Indonesia is probably approaching an oversupply situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At best, if you can identify Real Kopi Luwak, there might be something slightly more appealing about it compared to beans from the same estate that were not, erm, &quot;processed&quot; by some wild Luwak &quot;cherry-picking&quot; the best beans. More likely, though, no matter what you try, it will just taste how it tasted to me wherever I went: like something pooped out of some poor animal that was suffering from a serious caffeine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The taste was quite different too, water-first tasted a bit stale/watery (not much but there was a clear difference). Pour-over had a rounder and more full aroma, liked that one more.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say it would amplify it, and you may very well not be able to tell much of a difference. Unless the milk or cream is hot, your coffee won't brew very well (or at least not as fast) on just the milk alone. So by the time you add your hot water, it still shouldn't have dissolved the instant coffee enough to make much of a difference.&#xA;If you wanted to experiment, I would try adding some hot cream or milk to the instant coffee first and stirring it up a bit. Still probably wouldn't make much of a difference other than it tasting more like a latte. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This means that they &lt;strong&gt;ARE NOT&lt;/strong&gt; the limiting factor when it comes to the shelf life of a coffee. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, shelf life is not changed by flavouring the coffee as these compounds degrade (or go bad) after the coffee itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelf Life by Taste:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the coffee has been treated with flavouring compounds, it will hide certain aspects of degradation of the coffee due to aging, decaffeination, and oxidation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, these flavors help extend the shelf life of coffee by&#xA;  disguising changes in flavor due to decaffeination, oxidation, or&#xA;  aging processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Flavored-Coffee-Bean.html&quot;&gt;How Products are Made&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, shelf life by taste is changed, as the flavouring compounds mask the degradation and therefore the bad tastes of the aging coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Lighter roasts are going to have more of these flavors but it obviously depends on the bean as well. If all you are going to change is the method of brewing the coffee, I would recommend making sure you don't use too hot of a water temperature and trying to use a pour over. I find pour over allows for more delicate flavors you are describing, rather than something like aeropress which can approach more espresso type coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Roasting coffee dark may be used because it is easier to create a consistently flavored bean, with less monitoring and concern for flavor profiles. In the case of Starbucks they are shipping so much of their coffee to so many locations and creating so much coffee at once that it may be easier to create consistency. The darker you roast the less the flavor of the original bean matters, so it may also be used as a method to roast cheaper or lower quality beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Due to the age and usage of your Keurig machine, I would say that you are experiencing two possible problems - one at a time or perhaps both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motor in the pump in your Keurig machine may simply just be getting worn out. If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just be smart about it. You don't want to end up with permanent damage to your respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other possible problems (harder to fix):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be possible that a seal somewhere in the pump has worn out and air is entering the system as it is being pumped. This would involve replacing a seal and taking the machine apart though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be some other component, that I can't think of, that is damaged.

What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I was thus hoping I'd get a more consistent grind quality than my Hario hand mill. Unfortunately, the grind consistency appears to be slightly worse, and I think I can see lot of fines and variance in grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I'm new to this, so it could be that I have unrealistic expectations from a $229 grinder.

For example, normalized to a 200mL &quot;cup&quot; (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cold brew&lt;/a&gt; (45g per 200mL) than for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drip&lt;/a&gt; (14g per 200mL).

Thawing may affect them though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you thaw the beans, small amounts of water (that were frozen as small amounts of air humidity) will melt and it may collect together and cause some very small extractions in the bean. This is probably quite minimal due to the fact that you have vacuum packed the beans though. This is generally undesirable but it is up to you whether or not you want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do indeed freeze them, make sure that you let them thaw completely before opening the package. Do not open the package until they are back to room temperature. This is so that the humidity can stabilize inside. If you open the package earlier, moisture from the air may condense onto the beans, causing a small amount of extraction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how long they will last in the freezer? I am unsure of this as I have never frozen my beans as it is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Espresso - Dose affecting extraction time disproportionately"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a Pasquini Livia 90 and a Baratza Vario Ceramic grinder. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm finding that the only way to tame my extraction speed is by over dosing the basket. Specifically, by loading the basket so heavily that it pushes up against the shower screen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I use a double shot basket, I have to load 21+ grams to get the extraction down to a brew ratio of 2:3. Basically, I have to get it to the point where I'm struggling to insert the portafilter, otherwise the extraction speed is just incredibly fast. At the recommended starting point for the Vario grinder for espresso, (2Q), it takes about 7 seconds for an extraction using 16 grams of coffee in a double basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I stick to the recommended doses, and give the coffee some headroom from the shower screen, I end up having to use the finest possible setting (1A - 1E) on my grinder to 'slow the flow'. This results in extremely overextracted tasting coffee, which makes sense because the grind is like powdered sugar at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What am I missing here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Adjust accordingly until you get the sweetest shot you possibly can. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your general espresso recipe for a well roasted coffee should be somewhere around:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;20 grams of coffee in&#xA;extracted for 26 seconds&#xA;A yield of around 30 grams of espresso&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Aeropress coffee (hearby called Aerpresso in this post) is more concentrated than regular drip coffee.  However, if you are using similar amounts of grounds as you would in a drip machine, you shouldn't notice any difference.  Caffeine is highly soluble in hot water and most any extraction method utilizing hot water will result in nearly full extraction of caffeine from grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aerpresso ends up somewhere in caffeine concentration between espresso (very concentrated) and drip coffee (less concentrated).  However, the total amount of caffeine is dependent more on the amount of grounds used that the extraction method (with the above listed methods). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the the final answer is no.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've never heard of cheese and coffee pairings, but I've had coffee that has very wine like qualities. Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called &quot;dutch coffee&quot;, where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp;amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the &quot;dolce&quot; or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I come from the renowned cheese state Wisconsin, and I've been a long time coffee enthusiast.

In the &lt;em&gt;frob&lt;/em&gt; pass, we make just &amp;quot;coarse&amp;quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't &lt;em&gt;aimless&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twiddle. In the &lt;em&gt;twiddle&lt;/em&gt; pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &amp;quot;controls&amp;quot; for the quick little &amp;quot;experiments&amp;quot; to check each change.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tweak. In the &lt;em&gt;tweak&lt;/em&gt; pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The controls we have available are the &lt;strong&gt;grind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dose&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;water quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt;. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &amp;quot;clicks&amp;quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &amp;quot;full&amp;quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; of the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; of the water quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we've done our &amp;quot;frob&amp;quot; pass. Now &amp;quot;twiddle.&amp;quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; per se: there's no *up and down&amp;quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then do a &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &amp;quot;range&amp;quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There should be no need to &amp;quot;twiddle&amp;quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, one final pass to &amp;quot;tweak&amp;quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &amp;quot;overextraction stain&amp;quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop &lt;em&gt;just before&lt;/em&gt; the color changes. This tweak gives you &amp;quot;ristretto-quality&amp;quot; shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on-the-fly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &amp;quot;comfortable&amp;quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &amp;quot;ride the wave&amp;quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same three adjustments, &lt;strong&gt;frob&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, apply also to dynamic adjustments. &lt;strong&gt;Frob&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;coarsest&lt;/em&gt; control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. &lt;strong&gt;Twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;medium-grain&lt;/em&gt; control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. &lt;strong&gt;Tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;finest&lt;/em&gt; control is the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with more &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little finer so you can achieve the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with less &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;. (Volume is constant.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser.

But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Appendix: The &amp;quot;David Schomer&amp;quot; method or &amp;quot;ritual&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what I remember from the amazing book, &lt;em&gt;Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques&lt;/em&gt; by David Schomer.

When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is &quot;clogged&quot; in this way. I attribute this clogging to the oil on the surface of the beans that is somehow &quot;sticky&quot; and more prevalent on darker roast beans, but I'm not certain. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/318466&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This article from Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt; talks about cleaning more frequently for darker roast beans, as does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/videos-home/ask-the-experts/burr-test-medium-dark-beans&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this review from Seattle Coffee Gear&lt;/a&gt;, as does &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/grinding/burr-grinders/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one from Coffee Review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the topic of &lt;strong&gt;espresso pulled from these grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; This is tricky and I'm really just speculating. Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more &quot;watery&quot; shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This article from Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that?

Depending upon the critical mass required to have an effect and the quantity consumed, it may take several periods of halving before the compound is &lt;em&gt;out of your system&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If 72 hours gets you to where you don't feel the &quot;dependency&quot;, it might be possible to reduce that by controlling your caffeine intake when you do drink coffee. You could try half-caff (IMO best to make your own blend, and don't skimp on the decaf part: Decaf should cost more because it costs money to decaffeinate the beans). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also try alternating with hot chocolate or a flavorful herbal tea (my latest fav is Yogi Teas Egyptian Licorice). A significant part may be the psychological aspect of the &lt;em&gt;ritual&lt;/em&gt; of having a cup of hot coffee. Having a cup of hot &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; may just satisfy that need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm not exactly sure if this is accurate, but I think it has to do with flavor extraction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you brew with a filter, the water is going to fall through the grounds too fast to actually develop good flavor. Sure, you'll get coffee, but you're only giving the water enough time to take the more bitter tastes with it. I have this same problem with my coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you brew directly into water, all of the water is in contact with all of the grounds for a considerably longer amount of time. The water will extract the bitter tastes AND the more flavorful aspects of the grounds, which is why you thought this tasted better. It wasn't just bitter, it was bitter and flavorful, and that's coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're not doing anything wrong with the filtered methods, it's simply a matter of opinion among coffee tasters. Some people enjoy the convenience of fast, filtered, and bitter coffee because it's what they know as coffee. The reason the Turkish method isn't suggested is because, the way you describe it, it sounds like the grounds stay inside the coffee, and many people loathe having to deal with that--even though it produces much better coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, you're not doing anything wrong; however, the reason you're finding flavor differences is that the extraction of flavors is far different between the two methods!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

My first attempts, following the instructions enclosed with the roaster turned out horribly, tasting both charred and grassy at the same time.  Yeechh.  After doing some online reading, I've greatly lengthened the roasting process with mostly good results.  I'm currently roasting batches of 90g of raw beans for between 12-17 minutes.  My thinking is that this is giving the beans time for the proper reactions to take place inside the beans without charring the outside.  But I've read that some commercial roasters might take 20 minutes or more to roast a batch.  Of course they are roasting much larger quantities than I am but it occurred to me that perhaps this longer roasting time is intentional and has some beneficial effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly aiming for a City or City+ roast level and want to know if lengthening the roast time beyond what I'm currently doing is a good idea?

Some of the more expensive machines even have &quot;roast profiles&quot; preprogrammed to modulate the temperature up and down for desired results.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I think there is a point of diminishing returns between the time dinkering with the roaster and the difference in the taste.  Most of my roasting lands in the 15 to 16 minute range and comes out even enough that I feel good about it.  I recommend drawing the time out just enough that the results are even enough for you and you are comfortably hitting your target roast level the vast majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This isn't particularly authoritative nor scientific. I don't immediately find any good online resources on this; one video that I don't care to link or watch, and another article from &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/best-ceramic-coffee-dripper-pourover-hario-bonmac-bee-house-kalita-reviews.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Serious Eats on dripper styles&lt;/a&gt; but it doesn't compare the filters themselves as such. So, I'm going rogue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The different cone (and filter) manufacturers each have their own shape, presumably to ensure product lock-in for consumables (in this case, primarily filters). Here are the three primary ones that I'm aware of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqO7d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brown paper filters&quot;&gt;&#xA;Clockwise from upper left: off-brand Melitta-style #2, Hario brand V60 02, Chemex brand pre-folded bonded. All are &quot;natural&quot; brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Chemex filter page&lt;/a&gt; states that they are &quot;20-30% heavier&quot; than other filters and removes finer sediment and &quot;undesirable oils and fats&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Melitta brand filters&lt;/a&gt; have claimed &quot;flavor enhancing perforations.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method. This brown (&quot;natural&quot;) style seems to be called &quot;Misarashi&quot; for reasons I don't understand. There's little information on the Hario (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/v60-filter-papers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;.jp&lt;/a&gt;) pages about the nature of the filters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don't notice a significant difference in coffee draining rate (throughput), but I suspect there is. I (personally) think there's a slight difference in taste and output of the brew, but perhaps I'm fooling myself into legitimizing more coffee gear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1969/262&quot;&gt;this other question about Hario V60 filters&lt;/a&gt; off-brand filters do not seem common (in our regions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;These grooves are for improving the flow of coffee through the filter. The grooves create space between the filter and the cone to permit little channels for the coffee to flow into the vessel after passing through the filter paper. I think the ridges also help &quot;wick&quot; the coffee away from the filter paper, helping the filter paper drain better.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the ridges are absent (as in Chemex cones, for example) the brewed coffee sometimes wells up between the filter paper and the cone.

Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. &lt;strong&gt;Has anyone else tried it?&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any drawbacks to this method? It isn't worth much commercially because it only makes decent coffee one cup at a time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method is adapted from one I saw used by fisherman in Brazil, except he used a sock instead of a tea strainer.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback is that you might add the grounds to too hot water. Especially avoid adding the coffee to water that is still boiling. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation#Boiling&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has some references about the temperature and it states that boiling water will extract bitterness instead of aromatic oils. So just make sure to wait a moment after taking the water off boil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second drawback is that since the grounds remain in the pot in contact with the water, you have to empty the pot entirely once the coffee is &quot;done&quot;. Leaving the grounds in contact with the water for longer times will only add betterness to the coffee. Of course this is no problem if you only make one cup, but prepare to have a (pre-heated) container ready if making more cups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related to the second drawback is that the extraction will continue in your cup because of the sediment, but in my opinion most people will not even notice it affecting the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol/#.VbiFUPnsT3w&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee oils make it to the news&lt;/a&gt; from time to time.

After that I should let it flow out and fill the water up until it's reached the 1 cm mark over the powder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His method is a bit different. He just pours the hot (even if it's still boiling) water into the filter. He briefly moistens the coffee and then lets the rest of the water pour into the filter until his water can is empty. He only pauses from pouring if it reaches the top of the filter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said that his method isn't good, as the water will flow faster through the filter and the coffee won't be as aromatic as it would be with my method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brewing process I'm using is using the hand-filter with the Hario V60.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which method is better? Does it matter how fast to pour the water in? Does it matter if the water is just hot or still boiling?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You're highlighting two differences between the two methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;temperature of the water, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;rate of pouring the water (equivalently, how &quot;full of water&quot; is the cone).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Short story: Use water just off the boil (about 96°C / 205°F). I prefer your &quot;slower&quot; pour method over your friend's... read on for why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer story:&#xA;Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; Most agree that water for pour-over should be &lt;strong&gt;just off the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but exact temperature is both difficult to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of &lt;strong&gt;93-97°C / 200-207°F&lt;/strong&gt;. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the &quot;right stuff&quot; from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an &quot;off&quot; taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, &lt;em&gt;I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.&lt;/em&gt; It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of pouring the water.&lt;/strong&gt; This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final &quot;drainage&quot; and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. &lt;strong&gt;I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; at a steady rate.&lt;/strong&gt; The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinsing your filter&lt;/a&gt;, and see more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom&quot;&gt;wetting the grounds for coffee bloom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;strong&gt;mass-market coffee like this might &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from AeroPress treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robusta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Robusta produces &lt;strong&gt;more crema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in espresso, and might be a way to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;more crema from AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;. Robusta also has slightly &lt;strong&gt;more caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Arabica&lt;/em&gt;, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, &lt;strong&gt;you might reduce a bit of the bitterness&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There might be a few problems, though.&lt;/strong&gt; First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like &lt;strong&gt;Maxwell House is rather course&lt;/strong&gt; for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bunn&lt;/a&gt;). Second, if there are other &quot;stuff&quot; in the coffee (e.g., &quot;Folgers Crystals&quot; or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

More info on this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/23051/what-kind-of-cookware-is-suitable-for-a-glass-ceramic-stovetop&quot;&gt;a question on Seasoned Advice&lt;/a&gt;, and recommendations from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000221.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;GE Appliances&lt;/a&gt; for their own stovetops.

If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a &lt;em&gt;gas&lt;/em&gt; flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your &quot;mileage&quot; may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more &quot;DIY&quot; adventure as you suggest, &lt;strong&gt;consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source&lt;/strong&gt;.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As far as actual speed, that based mainly on the barista working shift, the load, and amount of available equipment.  Starbucks does not have any patented magic equipment that  lets them pull shots faster than any other coffee house (that I am aware of).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy their beverages, then there probably isn't any reason you shouldn't continue to drink it.  I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their &quot;espresso&quot; blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and &quot;highest end products&quot; are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced &quot;good enough for everyone&quot; standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;What to keep in mind is, that during the middle ages, alcoholic drinks were pretty much the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/268/did-everyone-drink-beer-in-the-middle-ages&quot;&gt;main beverage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Before public sanitation, cholera and other water-transmitted diseases&#xA;  were a significant cause of death. Because the process of brewing any&#xA;  beer from malt involves mashing and boiling which effectively&#xA;  pasteurizes the wort, and the fermentation and hops protect against&#xA;  infection, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape&#xA;  infection. It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who&#xA;  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints&#xA;  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia on &quot;Small Beer&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a lightly alcoholic beverage)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://gladwell.com/java-man/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Malcom Gladwell&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrialization–to help “large numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.” Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called “beer soup.” (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: “Heat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.”) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. That’s what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, let’s not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held true–that in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Ground beans have a much larger surface area by weight than whole beans. When the surface of the bean is exposed to air chemical reactions take place. I doubt that these reactions have been completely characterized but at a minimum they include some loss of aromatic oils. In other words, the processes that lead to a judgment that coffee is &quot;old&quot; happen faster in ground coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can do the experiment easily and cheaply by comparing the results of coffee made with freshly-ground and pre-ground versions of same brand/date coffee. You can always borrow a grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experiment might not work if both samples of coffee are old (or poor quality). Otherwise I think you would notice a difference. Whether the difference is worth paying for is a different question; but the only costs are a grinder and time to grind the beans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short answer to the question about brands might be: good, fresh Arabica beans are similar in many ways, up to roasting. Some people prefer a light roast, others medium or dark. Once you decide, find a brand that does what you like consistently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and &lt;em&gt;dried thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; in The Right Way.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;care&quot; page for Bialetti&lt;/a&gt; (follow that link, then click on the &quot;Care Use&quot; tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to &lt;em&gt;dry thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; and most tellingly &quot;Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation.&quot; Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and &lt;em&gt;facilitates&lt;/em&gt; further oxidation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and clean&lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;) as the metaphorical &quot;whistle&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1849&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup (&quot;scale&quot;) from using &quot;hard&quot; water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this.

With pour-over methods, this will depend on the size and shape of the funnel, the porousness of the filter paper and the grind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Balinese coffee, there is no control.

They're white, so no need for artificial colors here, all they need is some machine to make the cool patterns and all the other cool stuff. Same goes for chemicals.&lt;/del&gt; Read the comments for that answer for more information about chemicals that may be inside the paper towel. White paper towels are usually the ones with the lowest chemical content compared to other colored paper towels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the comments, brown paper towels will make your coffee taste like one. Not good at all. Bleached towels should be avoided as they contain bleach or CI (chlorine). And who knows what hidden chemicals could be used in the non-bleached ones, any from A-Z really. So use the paper towels with caution as you might be drinking bleached coffee instead...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how strong your paper towel is, the strength of your coffee will vary.

I'm interested in taking things a bit more seriously and would like to be a bit more meticulous when it comes to roast level.  I find that my popcorn popper (1200 W) roasts coffee a little too quickly, to the point that it becomes difficult to get a precise and consistent roast level from time to time.  Does anyone know of anyway that I could reduce the power of the roaster?  If it roasted at a lightly slower pace I feel like I would have better control over the process.  I've heard people suggest plugging it in through an extension cord or a power strip, which will reduce the power going to the popper.  Is there a more principled or controlled way of doing this?  Some sort of device that goes in between the popcorn popper plug and the outlet that would let me adjust the power at a fine granularity would be ideal.  Does this sort of technology exist?  Perhaps a sort of light switch dimmer would work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The hole in the popper was roughly 3 inches so I got a 3 to 4 inch duct adapter, a 4 inch flour sifter and mushed it all together, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://207.66.12.210/CoffeeRoasting/3CupSetup.jpg&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  The result was that I moved the coffee away from the heat source.  The sifter also allows you to stir and get more even results.  I think I went from 4 to 5 minute roast time to 7 or 8 minutes with this method and the parts were very cheap. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;amp;t=5331&amp;amp;start=20&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; for that picture actually has additional mods close to what you may be looking for if you actually want to take your popper apart and try rewiring it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Espresso tastes different than percolator coffee, but not necessarily better.  Espresso extraction produces a more concentrated drink with a different set of compounds that you would get with percolator extraction.  With a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, espresso will have a slightly different set of compounds than you would get from the same coffee with percolation.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people prefer a more concentrated taste, however, some do not (many people think espresso is &quot;too strong&quot; when drank straight, thus the popularity here in the US of mixed espresso drinks).  This doesn't mean it's necessarily better.  Some types of beans are not well suited to espresso extraction and will actually produce a better cup when brewed with other methods.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All coffee can be benefited or hindered by brew/prep method, but the quality of the bean and it's roast have quite a bit of influence in the matter.  Badly grown, processed and roasted coffee will not magically be made better by espresso extraction.  It might actually end up worse because concentrating it can highlight it's flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Ground coffee is just the roasted coffee beans ground up to a fine powder. In order to make the beverage coffee, you need to combine this with hot water to extract the flavour (there are many different ways to do this). Typically, there is a filter that makes sure that the water can pass through the ground coffee but none of the ground ends up in your drink. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instant coffee is dried brewed coffee - they grind up the coffee beans, brew the coffee and then remove the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A coffee machine or coffee maker is used for brewing coffee from ground coffee, not instant coffee. Instant coffee powder just needs to be rehydrated, so adding hot water is enough. It will completely dissolve in the water, which the ground in a coffee maker will not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine you bought seems to be an espresso machine (it puts the water with high pressure through the ground coffee). This requires a relatively fine ground. Preground espresso will probably work, or you can also buy a grinder and grind the beans yourself. It also seems to have a pressurized filter basket, which means it will be quite forgiving and therefore easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The aeropress does not produce crema. There is no where near enough pressure using the aeropress to produce crema. Crema doesn't make coffee better, its typically a sign of good espresso, but isn't found in any other form of brewing nor is it what make the coffee actually taste better. French presses don't create crema either, and its a misleading yet common belief that they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aeropress likely has about the same amount of oils as a pour-over cup of coffee if you're using the paper filters. The aeropress get it's richness from its style of brewing known as &quot;immersion brewing&quot;. Longer contact with the grounds extracts compounds usually left behind by pour-over/drip methods. Combine with pressure, the aeropress, in short, just extracts more flavor by having a longer brew time and an environment which increases solubility with pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AeroPress has a short &quot;brew time&quot;, however what I was meaning to say is that the aeropress and other immersion brewers have a longer contact time of the bean and the water. Therefore you have more extraction. The aeropress, unlike any other immersion method uses pressure to increase solubility. It's known that if you increase pressure that you extract quicker, and your solvent(water in this case) is able to achieve higher saturation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

In addition, flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and&#xA;  muscle pain/stiffness were judged likely to represent valid symptom&#xA;  categories. In experimental studies, the incidence of headache was 50%&#xA;  and the incidence of clinically significant distress or functional&#xA;  impairment was 13%.

In general, the incidence or severity of symptoms&#xA;  increased with increases in daily dose; abstinence from &lt;strong&gt;doses as low&#xA;  as 100 mg/day produced symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You'll probably be able to get away simply with ground &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;cardamom/cardamon&lt;/a&gt; added to the grounds&lt;/strong&gt; when you're &quot;pre-infusing&quot;/steeping the coffee grounds in the AeroPress. It's probably best to use &lt;strong&gt;very finely ground, freshly ground&lt;/strong&gt; cardamom seeds. You may even wish to &lt;strong&gt;grind the cardamom seeds along with your coffee&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., in the grinder at the same time); you'll get similarly-fine grind. However, you might get a bit of cardamom flavour left over in the grinder; this may (not) be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As another option, you could also consider &lt;strong&gt;a sprinkle of the dry, ground spice into the cup after brewing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cardamom or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_cardamom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;black cardamom&lt;/a&gt;, one might also consider cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, anise, or other &quot;baking spices.&quot; Any of these could be used in a similar way. For example, I sometimes use freshly grated nutmeg in the grounds when brewing pour-over, and it gives a nice smell and a hint of flavour in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also &lt;strong&gt;consider using an extract or essential oil&lt;/strong&gt; or some high-intensity flavouring like that. You'd probably want to add that to your cup &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see a few problems that you might have to work around&lt;/strong&gt;, specific to AeroPress, that you might run into with any of these spices. One problem you might encounter is the &lt;em&gt;rather short infusion time&lt;/em&gt; commonly used in AeroPress; an option might be to try to &lt;strong&gt;steep the spice in the water as you're bringing it to the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but you risk burning the spice or otherwise contaminating the kettle (but might be worth a try to boil in a regular cooking pan). Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; More thoughts based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2430/262&quot;&gt;a later question&lt;/a&gt;: There's a few other suggestions from recipes like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kinfolk.com/recipe-cardamom-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/try-this-cardamom-coffee-180331&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (somewhat arbitrary top search hits). The former suggests &lt;em&gt;using a French press / cafetière&lt;/em&gt; (providing longer steeping time for the spice) and the latter recommends &lt;em&gt;grinding the spice with the coffee beans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Using more or less beans in a single grinding session&quot; will yield the most bang for buck, usually.  However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.  That helps, but is far from a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Heat during grind isn't an indication of a low-quality grinder, rather, little to no heat is simply an indicator of a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high-quality grinder. There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; gingerly, which takes lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can also be the bean, some roasts just &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/&quot;&gt;Lavazza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us&quot;&gt;Illy&lt;/a&gt; produce a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

From my experience the only thing that has imparted a burnt rubber taste is either from over or under extracting, or from buying a dark roast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because a bean is Arabica doesn't ensure that it is going to ensure a certain flavor profile or certain quality.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I guess measure density just like you would in a college-lab? Just use a graduated cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extraction is mostly about how efficiently you can extract coffee solubles with an amount of liquid. Since refractometers are pricy, you can use a 0.1g scale and a graduated cylinder, to measure how heavy your shots are. The denser the better, however you also have to be practical with how long your shots take to be pulled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I would feel confident drinking out of a ceramic mug after a good scrubbing with soap and water.  Smooth (glazed) ceramic surfaces are more easily cleaned than rough ones, so perhaps the rough ones deserves extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is a concern about sanitizing the mug, putting water in the mug and leaving it in the microwave on high until the water boils should kill any mold.

Discovered by a French chemist in 1910 the MRx is what is largely responsible for transforming the mere handful of compounds found in green coffee (unroasted) to the complex aromatic beverage that it is today. As temperatures reach 150°C (302°F) the MRx causes free proteins to combine with sugars to form aromatic compounds such as furans which impart sweet, caramel like notes to the coffee. &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More on this chemical reaction  here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coffeechemistry.com/library/coffee-science-publications/unlocking-coffee-s-chemical-composition-part-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.coffeechemistry.com/library/coffee-science-publications/unlocking-coffee-s-chemical-composition-part-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember.

We are expecting 300 people to each drink 3 cups of coffee over the whole event so up to 900 cups of coffee in 24 hours!!

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Your problem depends more on the shape of the data than the raw quantities. 900 cups in 24 hours is one cup every 40 seconds or so, which isn't so bad, however I doubt that's the distribution of actual orders!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume all of your 300 guests want to have a cup of coffee during a one-hour period. This works out as 5 coffees a minute, or one every 12 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm ignoring factors of manpower, cost etc., and focussing on coffee preparation only :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones. Assuming each one takes ~6 minutes to cycle (prepare, brew for 4 mins, serve, rinse), meaning you can serve 2 people a minute with one pot. 3 pots would allow you to serve 6 people a minute (amortised) and serve 300 people in an hour. A few more pots would make it very comfortable. Assuming you're grinding the coffee fresh, you'll get a far superior brew from this than perk coffee that's been sitting there for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So serving people fast enough shouldn't be too hard, but boiling water fast enough might be, and for that you just need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgVDG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt;, with which you can keep a large enough supply of boiling water to just fill up and go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a large variety of factors that can affect bean size.  Obviously growing conditions can vary, and there is often variation of size within a single crop.  Keep in mind coffee is an agricultural product.  No one blinks when a crop of apples or oranges has a great variety in sizes, but many people seem to prefer their coffee beans a more uniform size.  Most places accomplish this with sorting but it is artificial to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, roast level is a controllable process that greatly affects bean size.  Beans expand and become less dense as they are roasted and lose moisture.  It is entirely possible that the same crop of sorted beans (all relatively uniform in size) will have different sizes due to variation in roast level.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Caffeine does not break down (at any appreciable rate) when left alone in a drink. It requires the enzymes in your body to break it down, so when you take the drink out of the fridge, it'll be just as caffeinated as when you put it in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, your drink will still be stale, because there are plenty of other organic compounds in the coffee that will break down over that time, affecting the taste. Also, assuming you reheat the coffee, the reheating will have further effects, making it taste very bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either make yourself a smaller coffee (16oz is a lot!) or drink it all when it's fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My thought is that once you turn on the machine, the machine starts to heat the water. Often the heating system is regulated by a PID regulation (Maybe on-off regulation). The machine will heat the water fast to make sure you can get your cup of coffee:) Once the water is heated it will stabilize to the intended temperature. If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans. After a while the temperature is stabilized and you will experience that the coffee is no longer acidic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that the pipes within the machine are not clean. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can test both. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try turning on the machine an hour before making the first cup. If this helps it is probably a temperature issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If not try to clean the machine by running through hot water before making the first cup. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope one of these solutions will help you with your issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Life is too short for bad coffee&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

You are talking about purposefully inducing a cycle of addiction/dependence and withdrawal, however, I am not sure I have ever heard that the exercise tolerance from caffeine decreases as caffeine tolerance increases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In cycling (a sport I am familiar with) most pros maintain some level of caffeine tolerance.  I've the routine before the day's workout is an espresso or two.  I've never heard of cycling that caffeine intake.

Not really any specific information about what is contained in the mess of supplements they are taking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on that study and the lack of information for cycling caffeine tolerance, I'd suggest that the withdrawal symptoms and side effects of caffeine consumption on naive individuals are not worth the purported but undocumented benefit of cycling your caffeine consumption.  I think while it's true that some of the mental stimulation and other effects of caffeine may taper off with tolerance, the exercise tolerance benefit does not.  However, individuals ignorant of this, or seeking mainly the mental stimulant part of caffeine effects, may resort to cycling their caffeine intake.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The bottom line is for physical performance, there is not a reason to cycle.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Just guessing here, but the hole could keep the water from going up until it reaches a certain temperature. The amount of pressure from the steam varies on the temperature of the water, and if there weren't enough pressure, the water would recycle. However, if the pressure were greater, the velocity of the water would prevent it from dripping out of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could explain the bursts, since the pressure would rise and fall depending on the amount of water it pushed out. The more water that escapes, the more room there is left behind for pressure to fill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, you mentioned a weird taste. Could it be metallic? If so, you could try letting the base sit in a strong coffee/water mixture for a couple days. The moka pot needs to be seasoned to prevent this taste, so I would recommend not washing it with soap - just rinse. My grandmother has never washed hers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I would recommend looking for which coarse setting seems to produce the most even grind. Really, the only potential danger you have is grinding so fine that you can't push the screen down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I recommend this is, like you mentioned, because everything else can be altered to your coffee's grind - the water temperature and extraction time. So you'll want to dial in a grind that's going to be evenly extracted. If your most coarse setting gives you big chunks and a lot of fine particles as well, then you're either going to over extract the fine and under extract the coarse, or vice versa depending on your brew time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hesitate to give you a dogmatic answer because I don't want to mislead you, but I also understand that it takes time to recognize even grinding and the grind size that is appropriate for the brew method. So I'll say that somewhere around medium to medium-coarse is going to be better. With smaller burr grinders, the coarsest setting has pretty uneven results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, try playing with the extraction time. Start with two minutes, then try 3, on up to 5. If you keep everything consistent, you should be able to find exactly what works/tastes best for your situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A couple of questions/answers on this site make it clear that many people feel that coffee is addictive, at least for some fraction of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;My question, for those who believe coffee is addictive, is whether and how it should be regulated? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am leaving the notion of &quot;regulated&quot; open. It could mean banning sales of coffee to minors, collecting a surtax to fund treatment, printing warnings on containers, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the emerging addiction-lore on the web I think it would be naive to assume that coffee would never be regulated. So I am interested in the extent to which people entertain or support regulatory ideas we currently associate with more potent drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one really believes that coffee is harmful and addictive, wouldn't one at least support a warning label on cups? Restricted sales to minors? The dangers listed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2127/will-i-be-addicted-to-caffeine&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; well-received answer, if one accepts them, seem to commend at least mild warnings.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edited 11/13 to link earlier question/answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;One thing is clear is that caffeine is addictive there are withdrawals when it is cut abruptly from the diet; however, in saying that coffee itself should not be regulated. Regulation on coffee would be like regulating tea, a drink that has been used for thousands of years will no ill effects. In the US coffee is the number one source of antioxidants therefore being a positive force for national health.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The perfect ratio for me seemed to be 2 tbsp per 6 oz cup. It was much better with a little sugar, even though I typically don't add sugar to my coffee. It tasted good, smells great, was more filling then a normal cup of coffee. But the taste was not great, so i won't be drinking it again unless I find a way to improve the taste. The bottom of the cup was very bad because it did not mix fully. So i would recommend blending for anyone who wishes to recreate the coffee treat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/iS9WJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/iS9WJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Coffee Peanut Butter&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While disapointed with PB coffee.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It boils down to taste - some people even chew whole beans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Safety-wise there are no concerns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the method you propose is not unheard of, it goes by the term &quot;Cowboy coffee&quot; and others. Some preparation methods even quickly boil the grounds and water (Turkish coffee), other sources warn against pouring boiling water over your grounds and suggest letting the water cool a few degrees first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is up to you to decide whether you like the grainy residue you might taste if you don't let the grounds settle enough before drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and do a taste test. You can always pour your coffee through a sieve or use the leftovers for drip coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There is some discussion whether the slightly higher content of coffee oils compared to filtered matters healthwise, but that's a very vague subject, IMHO.

The total anthocyanin content did not change immediately, but decreased 24% throughout the yoghurt shelf-life. The individual compounds, (+)-catechin (60%), (-)-epicatechin (60%), kaempferol (33%) and quercetin-3-rutinoside (29%) decreased after 24h in the yoghurt made with the strawberry preparation. During the remaining period of storage these compounds increased by 47%, 6%, 4% and 18%, respectively. Pelargonidin-3-glucoside decreased 49% after 28 d. Immediately after the addition of the strawberry preparation to yoghurt, β-lactoglobulin decreased to values lower than the limit of detection and α-lactalbumin by approximately 34%, and was reduced further slowly throughout yoghurt self-life. An immediate interaction between the carrageenan present in the strawberry preparation and β-LG was observed. The variations of both polyphenols and protein in the presence of carrageenan and the potential interactions were discussed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As noted above, some phytochecmicals are available to the consumer longer than others in the presence of dairy. To be fair to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/2/259.abstract?etoc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;American Institute of Nutrition study&lt;/a&gt; referred to in the Nestle press release, they do not indicate &lt;em&gt;for how long&lt;/em&gt; the antioxidants are still available after the introduction of dairy they only notate that after consumption they found coffee phenolics in the plasma of their test subjects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are antioxidants found in coffee. They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nestle press release found at &lt;em&gt;www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/good-news-milk-cream-coffee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whichever line of research you choose to follow, it may not really impact your health over much anyway. The National Center for Complimentary and Integrated Health summarizes antioxidant research saying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Several decades of dietary research findings suggested that consuming greater amounts of antioxidant-rich foods might help to protect against diseases. Because of these results, there has been a lot of research on antioxidant supplements. Rigorous trials of antioxidant supplements in large numbers of people have not found that high doses of antioxidant supplements prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NIH walks you through a lot of the findings at &lt;a href=&quot;https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You will either over-extract or under-extract the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over-extraction occurs when you run too much water through and you will be able to see this as the coffee turns pale and eventually you will end up with almost clear (or barely tinted) water running through. Over-extracted coffee tastes bitter. Really badly over-extracted coffee can sometimes exhibit metallic or plastic taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under-extraction is a much better option. The resulting coffee will be thicker, stickier and less bitter. The downside is that you are not getting the maximum utilisation from the beans and you could have made more acceptable coffee with those beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A ristretto is a short extraction with minimal water and ideally at a slightly lower pressure. An espresso should be the same coffee, but the extraction would use more water and often a slightly faster flow rate / higher pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The caffeine content will mostly be dependent on the beans used and the quantity of coffee in the pod. A longer extraction may increase the caffeine content slightly, but not enough to be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

These studies were done in a lab on extracted teeth, using moderate amounts of coffee on lab-grown plaques formed by bacteria from saliva. Antibacterial effect of coffee: calcium concentration in a culture containing teeth/biofilm exposed to Coffea Canephora aqueous extract,&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Letters in Applied Microbiology,&lt;/em&gt; Volume 59, Issue 3, September 2014, Pages: 342–347, N. Meckelburg &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can stain teeth. Is that a health issue? It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--&quot;&gt;article.&lt;/a&gt; Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH &amp;lt; 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but &#xA;a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology,&lt;/em&gt; Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al. To the extent that oral cancer is a dental health issue this is also something to weigh.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Science doesn't necessarily furnish a simple answer. It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Ideally, you want to get your caffeine during the lulls between cortisol spikes—otherwise, you start to develop a tolerance and have to drink more to get the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you're on a regular sleep schedule, your cortisol levels naturally spike about an hour after you wake up. If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm.

(For a more extensive list, see the link above.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of replacing coffee, they can also be mixed with coffee, &quot;stretching&quot; the yield of the coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to check your coffee for &quot;fillers&quot;, buy whole beans - none of the coffee substitutes look even remotely like coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Taste is subjective but a high-end espresso should not taste sour. Old coffee, poorly roasted coffee, and inferior grade coffee are the main culprits. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following is a pet theory, not science: cafes that charge a lot for coffee to cover overhead--or just because they think they can--sometimes have a low regard for the customer. Sometimes the best cup of espresso comes from a smaller cafe that depends on loyal customers for survival or is in business because the owner takes pride in serving good stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't have to say anything to get a less acidic shot.

From my Granny's time? 150 to 180 ml probably fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar rues apply for coffee, from a small espresso or mokka cup in southern Europe or the Arab world to a mug of filtered coffee in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be one correlation though - the &amp;quot;stronger&amp;quot; (=more concentrated) a coffee is customarily prepared, the smaller the cup.

Whereas with instant coffee, the process of creating these easily dissolving granules would have most likely caused shedding of a lot of the original substance content, which includes caffeine. Of course in this process manufacturers can add their own extras which might include extra caffeine but assuming that they don't, you would have lost some of the chemicals that keep you awake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If you choose copper, find a real thick copper one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, you can see a very good, thick copper cezve that I encountered. However, this is quite expensive (&gt;100$) and really hard to find even in Turkey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypCzp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypCzp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thick copper cezve&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The thermal capacity... The thermal capacity must be high. It's hard to explain this on text. The cezve must be a bit sturdy. This is all I can say. The copper ones aren't generally sturdy. A bit thicker stainless steel ones are nicer for that. So, you can brew your coffee fast and also homogeneously distribute the heat. This is quite important when preparing your coffee in your own hands. The traditional copper ones are traditional as copper was easier to produce historically. Steel is easier to shape now. So, you can go for steel. An indicator for good thermal capacity is the boiling character of your coffee. If your coffee starts to boil from the edges, then it is possible that the thermal capacity is less than it should be (or the fire is way too strong to brew coffee).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The bottom must be a bit larger than the top. So you can easily keep it on the oven.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The slope I can advice is abut 10 degrees from bottom to top for best brewing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The height must not be more than 10-15 centimeters to stir the coffee easily.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take care about right/left-handedness. Some cezves have the option to flow the coffee only on one side.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this will help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, I'm adding a photo of my own.

With a flat-bottom, 8-12 cup filter with only 3 tbsp of grounds, the grounds appear to be very loose (obviously).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I then try to stamp it down a bit with the tablespoon, but this makes the layer quite thin in my very non-expert opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the brewing is done and I dispose of the filter, I notice that there is a hole in the middle of the grounds where you can directly see the filter (no hole through the filter itself).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not so picky about taste, but this made me think that perhaps such a wide filter may not be suited for the small amounts I'm brewing.

Finer and you might overextract and result in a bitter brew; too-coarse and the machine won't extract properly or develop any pressure in the bottom chamber.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of water is almost completely determined by the size of the moka pot&lt;/strong&gt;. Fill nearly (but not quite) up to the over-pressure relief valve; looks a bit like a button. The moka pot is made to brew exactly that amount of coffee; no more, no less.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(exactly as you said). Amount of coffee: filled to the top of the funnel, but not tamped.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat: for a gas-flame-burner, as with any pot, matched to pot size is best. &lt;strong&gt;The flame being completely under and within the base is best.&lt;/strong&gt; It should heat quickly, but the flame should not creep around the sides; you want the bottom to be heated only, not the sides and certainly not the top vessel!

When I'm using the Nespresso (pull one ‘latte’, pull a second ‘lungo’ into the latte), I get maybe 9oz of coffee-product; and that's &lt;em&gt;stretching&lt;/em&gt; the phrase, as it's basically slightly-coffee-tainted steamed-milk.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Assuming you are not planning to buy a lot more machinery, you can simply use the Nespresso to make &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;espresso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - depending on your preferred strength, two to three shots should be what you need for your 20 oz mug. A Starbucks “Venti” is named for the twenty oz volume and contains three shots. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that's basically a puddle in your mug:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You need to fill the other 16 oz. and you do that with &lt;strong&gt;steamed (foamy) milk&lt;/strong&gt;. If you wanted to do this &quot;correctly&quot;, you would use the steam wand of your espresso machine - which the Nespresso doesn't have, I presume.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have an immersion blender, preferably with a disk, heat (not boil!) your milk and whizz it until you get soft foam.   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other options are a stovetop or electric milk frother - the manual pump-action ones are available for the price of four to five Starbucks coffees, the electric ones cost a bit more. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do not buy one of these teeny-tiny hand-held flimsy wire-whisk stirrers, they are a funny gadget but not sturdy enough for daily use and large volumes of milk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The milk-to-foam-to-espresso ratio is up to you, find what you like best.

(The same principle applies when you use a liquor.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, I'll splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;) and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in sort, get a classic Italian espresso roast, prepare it authentically and you should be fine.

According to this article, total amount of antioxidants &lt;strong&gt;in a regular coffee sold in the market&lt;/strong&gt; is changing in between &lt;strong&gt;19.8 to 41.9 mg per gram&lt;/strong&gt; coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My second reference is &lt;em&gt;&quot;Recovery of Natural Antioxidants from Spent Coffee Grounds&quot;&lt;/em&gt; by Alessia Panusa, Antonio Zuorro, Roberto Lavecchia, Giancarlo Marrosu, and Rita Petrucci which you can read its abstract &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf4005719&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

For instance, almost all Sumatran coffee is traditionally dark roasted by companies.  However, light roasted Sumatran coffee has a truly unique set of flavors that is fairly distinct from anything else, without light roasting some yourself, you'd be hard pressed (or French pressed if you are into that) to ever find it fresh.  Tastes are remarkably individual and it's highly likely that you like may really like some random type of coffee that either isn't a big seller and available, or isn't traditionally roasted how you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cons:&#xA;Time.  Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snobbery.  You will likely get to the point were most other coffee that's commercially produced will be unthinkable to you.  I can't drink coffee at any restaurant without cream (I normally drink it black).  I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin &quot;other&quot; coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.  If it's not you might be left with the terrible choice between doing something you don't love or buying less good coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Dealing with this question is simple: just make a direct comparison between bottled-water espresso and tap water espresso. Check if you taste any noticeable differences. If this is not the case, the tap water should be fine. While there may be &quot;guidelines for taste&quot; as far as the tap water vs. bottled water question is concerned (e.g., softer water is typically better), what tastes good and what does not is a very complex question - so the tasting is the only way to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that you will need to descale your machine from time to time in both cases - so using bottled water to avoid descaling is probably not cost-effective (nor environmental friendly).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It looks like a freshly baked brownie, whereas &lt;em&gt;roast B&lt;/em&gt;'s bloom is much less intense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is, what does this say about the beans for them to act one way or the other? My first thought was maybe it had to do with freshness of the roasted bean, but A and B could have the same roast date (less than a week old) and still act as described. Or maybe it's not freshness of the roast but freshness of the bean prior to being roasted? I'm not qualified to hypothesize the chemical reasons for behavior, but hopefully someone here is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Bean density varies dramatically with roast level.  The more roasted a bean is, the less dense it becomes.  My guess would be that less dense beans would have more of a tendency to float and more dense beans would have a tendency to sink.  However, I imagine that there are other factors as well.  Grind size would affect the mass vs surface size of the grounds and have some say as well.  Age could also be a factor since freshly roasted beans still contain/give off some amount of gas.  That degassing time can also vary with roast level and bean variety, so just time since roast may not always be a consistent measure.  Overall I'd guess there are four plus factors affecting the &quot;float&quot; of your grounds.  And that's not to even say anything about the content of the water itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;To start, I would highly doubt the beans were roasted there in store.  Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.  It doesn't effect the brew process very much either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As a follow up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2379/277&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; discussion of Turkish preparation, I'm wondering how to do the triple heating. This refers to the repeating sequence of heating the coffee in a cezve, and then letting it cool down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is about both stages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how do I know when it's heated enough to take it off the fire, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how much should it be cooled down?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The guides to brewing Turkish usually discuss that at the abstract level: heat + remove three times. I've been trying to do that, but my actions didn't seem to make sense. So right now I'm brewing it just once -- till the foam starts to rise, and enjoy it. But maybe I still can improve it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This is a very common misconception.  Coffee does not lose caffeine as it is roasted.  It is often misunderstood that darker roasts have less caffeine. Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process. Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process). If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine. If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.  The total amount of caffeine in a batch of beans changes very little, if any.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="What coffee and roast are best for Turkish?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Following a stream of very good discussions about aspects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turkish-coffee&quot;&gt;Turkish coffee&lt;/a&gt; preparation, here's a question about coffee selection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different brewing methods are thought to highlight different aspects of coffee aroma (e.g., darker roasts for espresso, but lighter for cold brew; see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1562/277&quot;&gt;discussion here&lt;/a&gt;). So often when you buy beans at a roastery, there is a recommendation regarding which methods are good for these beans &amp;amp; roast. Thus, a random bag of beans I'm looking at suggests they are good for batch-brew, aeropress, pourover and french press, but not for moka of espresso. But because Turkish isn't a big thing in many countries, it's never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May uneducated impression is that Turkish preserves the acidity and keeps bitterness low. Do you guys know what its profile really is?&#xA;Alternatively, maybe there is a way to predict the suitability of particular &#xA;beans for Turkish based on its character compared to other methods. E.g., &quot;beans good for aeropress will often be good for Turkish&quot;, or &quot;Turkish is the opposite of espresso&quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know when I like the coffee I made, so there are some favourites to my taste. But I can't disentangle the factors that contribute to my liking: is it the roast? the altitude? the mouthfeel? Which means I don't know what is more relevant, and this don't have properties to guide me in choosing new beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I believe the answer will be subjective. But, I can answer based on some tradition and history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The coffee beans &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; originated from Yemen in Ottoman Empire. At least, Yemen was a hub. (This fact is even mentioned in folk songs. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrRS9aNJJQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tr.wikisource.org/wiki/Kahve_yemen&amp;#39;den_gelir-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Historically, Robusta beans were not around, yet. Americas were not explored. So, if you want to follow the tradition, stick with African originated Arabica beans. Still, one should note that if you go for the current Turkish commercial ground coffee brands (like Mehmet Efendi, etc.) on the market, most of them include mostly Robusta beans from South America to keep the costs low. This is ugly face of horeca, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(African originated Arabicas are also my personal preference. My favorite is Ethiopian Harar. As far as I experienced, it is even better than Kopi Luwak for Turkish coffee. Also, this may be a hint. Kopi Luwak is known for low acidity. So, low acidity beans were not good for my taste even it was Kopi Luwak. On the other hand, Kopi Luwak was great while brewed with pressure.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For roasting the beans, you generally do not need to burn the beans to eliminate the acidity. So, light roasts are OK for Turkish coffee. Majority of commercial brands prepare City roast and the minority prepare American roast (I think). If you taste burnt flavor in a package, it is clearly over roasted; you must be suspicious about the quality of the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(My personal preference is a bit darker than that. City roast to full city roast.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last words:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, as Turkish coffee is just a brewing method, it is up to the drinkers taste either to add sugar/gum/cinnamon/milk or not, either to use Robusta or Arabica, either to roast light or dark. I mean, if the drinkers find it more delicious, they can boil it up for hours (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%B1rra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It exists!&lt;/a&gt;) before drinking. This is about the taste, so no boundaries. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

However, it doesn't fall within the standards of a true Italian espresso, as pointed out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/277&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;.

Although they are marketed as an espresso device for camping, they can be use wherever you have hot water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A step up for home is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aeropress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The way it operates is steep + push-filter (as in a French press), and the result ranges from filter-brew-like to espresso-like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next in price are probably &lt;strong&gt;the capsule espresso machines&lt;/strong&gt; (such as Nespresso and its clones), which many supermarket chains have cheap versions of. Very easy to use, but unsustainable (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/2501/2661&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/tea-and-coffee/articles/coffee-capsules&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and coffee enthusiasts won't consider them an option because of the taste (see the previous link). For related concerns, see the (excellent) answer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1572/277&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then come two best types: &lt;strong&gt;bean-to-cup&lt;/strong&gt; and traditional &lt;strong&gt;espresso machines&lt;/strong&gt; with a manually operated portafilter. They both are discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/333/277&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;. Both vary in price and quality significantly; probably a decent traditional machine may have a lower starting price than bean-to-cup machine. You may even find one not much more expensive than a capsule machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as easiness is concerned, capsule and bean-to-cup are obviously easier than moka pots or espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;While I do not own a Smart Grinder Pro, most local places that make cold brew/drip use a medium-fine grind.

I am sure there is a setting guide either that comes with the box or online that you can use for drip/cold drip. Just remember to keep it coarse enough so that it does not come out too &quot;powdery&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Image source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bruer.co/blogs/news/12222337-cold-bruer-experiments-with-grind-size&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.bruer.co/blogs/news/12222337-cold-bruer-experiments-with-grind-size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: My recommendation is to use the &quot;Drip Grind&quot; coarseness. That means, a grind that is not as powdered down as espresso; grinds should be no larger that ~1-1.5mm in diameter. Usually the finer a grind is, the more pressure is needed to account for the surface area created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

That's It simply means, it needs to be vaporized first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, just at the top of the coffee and filter, there is a condensation space. At that space the gas (vapor) returns back to liquid phase (water) and starts to drip. Therefore, you obtain a slow flow of heated (to the near evaporation point) dripping water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cannot think any other way of bypassing this flow.

Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of &lt;strong&gt;coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, I have a some &quot;Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso&quot; here, which is described by the producer by &quot;Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness&quot;. When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. &lt;strong&gt;But don't expect too much.&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Arabica Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; coffee beans should have a &quot;fine sweetness&quot;. Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - &quot;particularly sweet&quot; means in comparison to other beans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It depends on &quot;where&quot; the squeaking is coming from. Two contact points that might squeak are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the burrs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; themselves and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the top part of the crank rod&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The good news is that the whole thing dis-/re-assembles rather easily, and in fact this is pretty much necessary for changing the coarseness setting. I'd suggest two possibilities based on my own Hario manual grinder. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the ceramic burrs are squeaking, &lt;strong&gt;try grinding some very dark-roast beans&lt;/strong&gt; (E.g., French roast), which will have more oils on the surface than lighter-roast beans. Use a setting about as coarse as for drip coffee. This will naturally lubricate the bits that are rubbing together, and should reduce or eliminate the squeaking. I wouldn't recommend putting any (other) oil on the burr mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the crank is squeaking, take the top part of the crank apart as you would to change the coarseness setting. Remove the coarseness adjustment nut (looks like a toothed gear) completely. &lt;strong&gt;Oil the shaft and the top of the post through which the rod passes&lt;/strong&gt;, and make sure the oil is well distributed through the parts where the rod contacts. For the oil, I recommend using a food-grade mineral oil that you are comfortable with. Use a very small amount of oil (like a pinhead size drop in total). I wouldn't use a vegetable oil because it could become &quot;gummy&quot; or go rancid, and I wouldn't use anything non food-safe (e.g., not machine oil, not WD-40).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are not any firm guidelines established for what constitutes a specialty coffee.  Theoretically no one would consider anything made by Folgers to be a specialty coffee, and anything produced by a small local roaster should probably be considered specialty, but there is a lot of gray area in between.  For instance, some people may consider the bagged beans Starbucks sells to be specialty coffee, others (myself included) would not. Specialty is largely a marketing term like &quot;Cloud&quot; is for computing.  &quot;Cloud&quot; is used ambiguously for private, public, small, large, closed and open platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally I would define specialty coffee as something not produced and sold on a national scale.  Most specialty coffees are not &quot;branded&quot; by a company because they are bought in lots and sold sort of &quot;as is&quot;.  That is, the roaster bought X amount and when they sell through it, it is gone.  This is opposed to a larger company that will always have &quot;Sumatra Special&quot; available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you start talking about roasting with other things, or adding flavors, you have moved to &quot;flavored&quot; coffee, which I personally would never consider specialty coffee.  Oils and additional flavorings may be well liked by many people, but they can also be used to mask the shortcomings of less expensive beans and are generally used to produce a consistent tasting product.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly when you start talking about growing conditions, it can vary, and doesn't necessarily mean anything.  You can have beans that come from the same lot differ widely even in processing.  There is no &quot;perfect area&quot; to grow coffee and good coffee can be grown in a fairly well defined, but still variable conditions.  Advertising that coffee was grown in a specific place doesn't mean it was properly grown, harvested, processed or roasted well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Well first off what is your definition of ristretto? It's very frequently misunderstood to mean simply a short shot of espresso, when really it's all about your coffee to yield ratio. Ristretto styled shots range somewhere in the 1:1 to 1:1.5 range (arguably). For example if you put in 18 grams of coffee, and then yield out 20 grams of espresso (1:1.1)- then you are somewhere in the land of ristretto. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean as far as caffeine goes? There is no difference at all. Whether you are pulling a normale or a ristretto shot, you still want an extraction somewhere around 20% of the original coffee mass. This means that you are extracting the exact same amount of coffee, but simply putting that into a smaller amount of water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing to look at is that caffeine is one of the first compounds that is extracted in the extraction process. So even if you decided to pull the shot a bit short and under extract it, you should still have the same caffeine content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry I have no sources or citation.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;That is almost the opposite of my experience, after opening a bag of beans, they have noticeable less flavour after a couple of days.

Obviously, if beans are exposed to air for long enough, their quality is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the compounds improve, other does not. The most notable degradation in the first days is caused by the most volatile aroma compounds evaporating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the stalling of coffee as a function of time. Note that this is just a visualisation of the aroma compounds evaporating, not necessary a measure of quality.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;On my travel in paris, I ordered a cappuccino at a local cafe. What I got, was a large cup of coffee with a tennis-ball-sized whipped cream on top, decorated with chocolate syrup. Being like most Finnish, I did drink the cup without complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I feel I got served a cheap substitute for a cappuccino, I am not even sure if it was espresso but rather just filtered coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it because we were tourists, or the place being cheap, or was it just their local variation of cappuccino? I've always thought that cappuccino is supposed to have steamed milk foam on top, not cream from a can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How should I order my next cappuccino without insulting the waiter AND without whipped cream?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A short answer is &quot;not significantly&quot;, assuming you just store your drink for the day, and there is no sharp changes in storage conditions (strong heat, freeze, etc.)---except warming up the amount you want to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee drinks are unstable, though, and a simple, freshly passed drip coffee tastes different (quality changes) with time. So quality will actually change over a day, although the difference is hard to notice (except people with very acute taste sense).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are also adding milk, which softens the overall taste, so I think noticing changes in the coffee flavour is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every vending machine around me (every 100m or so) sells coffee drinks in PET bottles. These bottles are stored for several weeks, and they sell pretty well. They taste fine for that price point and quality, and they are very stable. Of course, they do not include only coffee. They include milk, sugar, and hard-to-spell things. The last category does contain taste stabilizer, etc., so that is unfair comparison. I am just thinking it is interesting to see that coffee in plastic bottles in actually pretty common, especially for relatively short times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Percolation and brewing seem used quite interchangeably in English, in many contexts, but not all.

Percolation sounds more technical and focusing on liquid getting through a filter. Brewing seems focusing more on &quot;solid into hot water&quot;, without involving necessarily a filter. This lets me think the words usage can be made quite accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the scope is &quot;restricted&quot; to English, as percolation is a Latin word, and it seems usage differs in English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;So there are two main differences between the Chemex and V60:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The V60 has a much finer filter than the Chemex, so extraction is much faster through the V60 filter, and more oils/solids come through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The V60 also has ridges, allowing coffee to easily pass through the filter evenly, rather than all having to exit through the bottom - washing out the grounds in the tip of the filter. The control you have over brewing time is much finer with the V60 as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the actual effect on taste, this will depend on the coffee you're using, and how you like it. The main quantitative differences will be the amount of oils and solids in the brew, and a longer brewing time overall. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Lately it's been having a lot of trouble pushing the water through the coffee.  We can hear the pump pumping, but the water just barely drips out.  We end up having to pull it 2 or 3 times to get a full shot (or just wait for the drips to fill up the shot glass).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I opened up this machine once before in the hopes of cleaning it, but found almost everything inside pretty clean and the plumbing is all sealed up.  So I'm a little befuddled as to what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do I fix my machine so that the shots come out in a single pull?  I wonder if my pump just can form enough pressure anymore - can I measure the pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A note on the grounds:  We have the grinder set to the finest grind, which comes out like a fine sand.  We've had it this way for a long time and not had any problems.  We fill the basket to about 1/2 full (it's a double shot basket, and we only need one shot - the single shot basket was fed to the garbage disposal years ago) and tamp.  I've been tamping more lightly recently, thinking that the problem was grounds that are too compressed to let the water through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As suggested in comment above, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/service/tech-tips/descaling-home-espresso-machine&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;descaling&lt;/a&gt; or decalcifying your machine may solve your problem. We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump. (I don't know what specific pump is employed by your machine, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://keithspecialty.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/can-i-damage-my-pump-if-i-run-out-of-water/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; may apply.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in the event that the pump has become weakened, it can be helpful to keep the reservoir completely full of water. I do not believe that a normally working machine would be affected too much by the grinding coarseness selected. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edited to add: While commercial descaling/decalcifying solutions are available (and might work really well) for this application, the staff on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/full-circle-single-cup-cleaning-descaling-liquid&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; selling such reports in the Q&amp;amp;A, &quot;Breville actually recommends using vinegar to descale their machines while you're under their warranty.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When deciding what to use, it may be to one's advantage to research whether the product is under warranty, and what the specific manufacturer recommends. Also, take into consideration that the unlisted chemicals that might be found in a given solution could put off foul odors and/or flavors (not that vinegar makes a good perfume, by any means).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S.  I just found out that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urnexbrand.com/attachments/FC_Single_Clean_Desc_GB.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;safety data sheet&lt;/a&gt; for one descaling liquid contains the following hazard warning (although the company might issue the same warning about vinegar if they sold it): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHS_hazard_statements&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;H315 Causes skin irritation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHS_hazard_statements&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;H319 Causes serious eye irritation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;For the LIDO grinders, burr drag, grinding, or touching is likely due to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;misalignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Misalignment is more likely an &lt;em&gt;assembly&lt;/em&gt; issue than a manufacturing issue since the burrs are machined. This means you can fix your Orphan Espresso LIDO on your own, with some handiwork and know-how.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I received my Lido E, the burrs would contact each other at anything tighter than +3.5 on the adjustment ring. After careful realignment, I got down to -5 from &quot;factory-zero&quot; before any contact, fixing a misalignment of over eight notches! -5 is now my new &quot;recalibrated zero&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My burrs are now much better centered than when it arrived, and I can get them extremely close together while keeping them fully free spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npVWLJnBcAs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Orphan Espresso's LIDO Maintenance Video&lt;/a&gt; is a detailed guide on how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble your LIDO. He only goes as far as to &lt;em&gt;approximately&lt;/em&gt; realign the burrs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGO_Onbx0NI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Orphan Espresso's LIDO Grider Burr Alignment Video&lt;/a&gt;, he focuses on burr alignment, going more in-depth. The video is very informative, but I believe alignment can be improved further with these additional steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Perfectly Align LIDO 2, LIDO 3, or LIDO E Burrs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do as he instructs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGO_Onbx0NI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the alignment video&lt;/a&gt; until 7:24&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He will:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tighten one adjustment screw while grinder is upside down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Turn the grinder right side up&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fully tighten all screws in opposing X-order&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Instead, I suggest:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep grinder upside down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lightly &amp;amp; evenly tighten all adjustment screws in opposing X-order&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hopper should be lightly secured, locking in the outer burr's alignment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Turn the LIDO right side up and loosen the adjustment ring until the burrs spin freely when the locking ring is locked.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly tighten the adjustment ring (and re-lock) bit by bit, turning the handle a full circle and testing for burr contact.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the first burr contact occurs, note the clock position of contact (e.g. 3 o'clock)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly tighten an alignment screw at either the same or the opposing clock position (e.g. either 3 or 9 o'clock) until burr spins freely again.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It will take some experimentation to figure out which screw to tighten.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, you may need to slightly loosen a screw to free the burr.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If all alignment screws are as snug as possible without introducing more burr contact, you're done. Otherwise, go back to step 4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If done correctly, the burrs will be so well-centered that when tightening the adjustment ring until first burr contact, the burr contacts in two or more (or all) places at once. The point of first burr contact is your new &quot;recalibrated zero&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this is doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The alignment video shows how to align the inner burr and outer burr before screwing in the alignment screws. The problem is that I found the burrs can still get misaligned during tightening of the alignment screws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My procedure addresses those last 1-2 turns of the alignment screws, between &quot;lightly&quot; and &quot;fully&quot; tightened. Slowly tightening whilst rechecking alignment makes sure that everything stays aligned even as the screws are fully tightened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

To my taste, &lt;strong&gt;the metal disk does produce a &quot;fuller&quot; bodied cup&lt;/strong&gt; (because more &quot;stuff&quot; comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that &quot;an average user&quot; (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I prefer the paper for a few reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;simple convenience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for my (personal) taste and preferences, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of &quot;sludge&quot; in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) &quot;health&quot; reasons. Paper filters remove some compounds (such as cafestol) that have purported cholesterol-affecting properties.

Longer time will allow the sourness to be offset by bitterness (compounds which are extracted after water has been in contact with grounds for a longer time).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try brewing the coffee as pour-over.&lt;/strong&gt; This will give you a more neutral preparation that will allow you to determine if the &lt;em&gt;coffee itself&lt;/em&gt; is of good quality and too your liking.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you roast coffee in an industrial glass kiln and it be drinkable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strange question and purely hypothetical. This came about with a discussion with one of my friends who is a glass maker at university.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first thoughts was that you could not control the temperature enough, however he did state that with glass making, the art is in how fast you can heat and cool down the kiln. So in effect, I don't think the temperature control would be an issue. I feel my issues are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rotating of the coffee&#xA;during the roasting (as it would not be in a drum). It's possible to &quot;spin&quot; glass in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_casting_(mirrors)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&#xA;way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Post roast cooling, would there be a way you could make a makeshift&#xA;cooling bed that would be somewhat effective.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drinkable&lt;/strong&gt; - I guess this depends on personal taste, so for the sake of this exercise I will state that drinkable as the quality of instant coffee. So something you would drink to be polite but not find any pleasure in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you can run the kiln at sufficiently &lt;strong&gt;low&lt;/strong&gt; temperatures and have a solution for stirring the beans, yes you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; roast coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Drinkable&quot; on the other hand is a hard to quantify term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you would roast the raw beans slowy until 200 - 230 C over a time window of 15 - 25 minutes, depending on desired darkness and roast type. &#xA;This allows for a long and slow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Maillard reaction&lt;/a&gt; and reduces the content of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chlorogenic acid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Your extremely hot kiln (&quot;cold&quot; glass techniques use temperatures over 800C!) woud be even harsher than industrial roasters with their &quot;90 seconds at 400 C&quot; method.

Decaffeination is done when the beans are still whole, so you can certainly find whole-bean, decaffeinated coffee (though I suppose decaffeination could also be done after grinding). The decaffeination process is often done with whole, green (not-yet-roasted) beans, which are subsequently roasted (still whole). Most places will sell whole-bean, decaf coffee -- local coffee roasters, coffee shops, markets, mail order from the usual suspects... &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.starbucks.co.uk/decaf-espresso-roast-fairtrade-certified/011037989,en_GB,pd.html?&amp;amp;srule=Featured&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;sz=12&amp;amp;cgid=whole-bean&amp;amp;prefn1=decaffeinated&amp;amp;prefv1=decaffeinated&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/whole-bean-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;illy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lavazza.co.uk/uk/at-home/blends/caffe-decaffeinato.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lavazza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peets.com/decaf-house-blend.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Peets&lt;/a&gt;, ...

I have noticed curdling especially in higher-acidity coffee -- e.g., especially in American-origin coffees and lighter-roasted coffees. No matter the preparation, I avoid soy milk in anything lighter than full-city roast. The resulting grainy texture is simply unacceptable! Though admittedly certain brands are less likely to split, especially if steamed, frothed, emulsified etc. as in for certain drinks like latte.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darker-roast coffees are more common (&quot;popular&quot;) &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; at mass-market chains, so I think that can also explain some of the prevalence of dark roasts for soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for taste, fat content and sugar content vary greatly for soy milk, even when discounting other additives like vanilla or other flavourings... so go for an unsweetened, un-flavoured brand. For my preference, the nuttier taste of soy milk is a good complement for Indonesian or other southeast-Asian coffees, which can be earthy, nutty, toasty, and take to darker-roasting well.

The filter is probably the reason, as it can block the oil and just let water get through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This oil, if confirmed, is what contains most flavour compounds, so I guess we want to keep it. On the other hand, it is aesthetically nicer to have a clean surface for the coffee drink, which means to act such that this oil is excluded at brewing time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure there is a tradeoff here, as &quot;clean&quot; surface coffees are very good (if prepared well), which means the flavour compounds did get down to the drink. So perhaps the surface oil is just that does not participate to the flavour. Any information on this topic?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Nice question. A similar myth has been arisen for Turkish coffee pot; such as it should be cleaned only with water to keep the greasy surface made with coffee oil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Partly correct, partly not. According to my &quot;Barista's manual&quot; from Lavazza, this sedimented oil may acetify. Thus, end up bad flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, (I cannot remember the source) as of my knowledge, paper filters are very good filtering everything; including those valuable oils. (That's why classical French press is still very common to prepare filter coffee, I think.) Paper soak in most of the flavor itself if it does not have proper fibers. This seems like the main problem of any drip coffee machine, V60, Chemex, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final words: keep it clean in the long run. You may not necessarily clean it until acetifying; which is you may keep it as it is up to one-two days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Same rule for Turkish coffee pots. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Terpenes are the lipids (oils) that give the main flavor to your cup. Therefore, you don't want to reduce them normally. However, if you really want to reduce them, best choice is, as stated thick filtered drip machines.

As coffee is heated from room temperature to near boiling points, you have (somehow) control over which lipids will evaporate during the process. You may modify the triple heating cycle of the Turkish coffee brewing to a single heating near or a bit over boiling point.

Brazil has some regions in which the harvest can be performed by machines, and others where this does not work so well. So in terms of coffee production, they have pretty much every coffee type and preparation type that exists. Given how large the country is, that's not exactly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you see a coffee marketed as being from Brazil, this is most likely to distinguish the coffee from the cheaper brands that mix all kinds of coffee from different parts of the world.

When&#xA;  roasting is completed the chaff falls off and is removed from the&#xA;  roaster. Like coffee, chaff contains a high nitrogen content which&#xA;  makes it a valuable product for environmental purposes, and each roast&#xA;  produces about 3.2 pounds of chaff. As part of our commitment to&#xA;  consciously great coffee we have found a way to recycle the chaff from&#xA;  every roast instead of tossing it into the dumpster. Since 2008 we&#xA;  have partnered with a company called Reconserve that converts bulk&#xA;  food waste materials into animal feed and who’s guiding philosophy is:&#xA;  recycle, reprocess, resource conservation. Reconserve picks the chaff&#xA;  up from our roasting facility in Sacramento, blends it with other&#xA;  bakery byproducts, and produces a feed supplement for dairy cows. We&#xA;  currently produce about 4,000 pounds of chaff each month, this means&#xA;  since 2008 we have recycled about 320,000 pounds of chaff into feed&#xA;  for cattle. We take our commitment to sustainability seriously and&#xA;  make sure that we are constantly evaluating every step of our process&#xA;  to see where we can make improvements.

The oil here is used to glaze the beans, which would then mix consistently when ground and brewed.

Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional &quot;home-grown&quot; coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vietnamese-coffee.com/vietnamese_coffee_about.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here you will find more information&lt;/a&gt; on how the technique for the beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope helps answer your question&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Then as you get dialed in, you can use the phases/color of crema to tell you information as it pulls. But with a lower-end machine - a pressurized portafilter is about as good as it gets until you spend more money. Espresso looks beautiful, but looks can often be deceiving. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear &quot;Ethiopian arabica&quot; or &quot;Indonesian robusta&quot; quite often.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Roast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there are also unlisted very very light roasts as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/how-to-create-green-coffee&quot;&gt;green coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The grind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grinding is also closely related to the targeted drink. For example, the coffee must be as fine as powder for preparing Turkish coffee. On the other hand, such fine grinding is so unpractical in French press as the grains could easily travel through the filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Choose a brewing method. As a subtitle, use proper equipment for that method. Master your brewing method. Needless to say, there are (probably) hundreds of them.

So, even serving the coffee is important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus article to the aforementioned ones, freshness. One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: &lt;em&gt;the customer not the espresso must wait&lt;/em&gt;. In one experiment it is shown that, if one day old ground coffee is used, the foam volume of espresso is 35% less than the one prepared by freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I am by no means a biochemist/physiologist, but I will give this my best scientific go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, &quot;get the 'itis&quot; as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what turns coffee grounds and water into coffee:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's an extraction process where aromatic compounds and oils and caffeine are extracted from the coffee bean into the water. It's a &quot;standard chemical process&quot;, done in millions of kitchens and cafés all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basic chemistry will tell you that the temperature of the solvent and other environmental parameters like pressure typically determine how fast this happens, but also the ratios of extracted substances, if applicable. Surface area comes into play as well, that's why e.g. coffee for espresso machines is ground finer than for filter machines. Using the same batch of beans in an espresso machine and a drip coffee maker gives you two &lt;em&gt;totally different&lt;/em&gt; taste profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same applies for extraction processes that use &lt;strong&gt;cold water&lt;/strong&gt;, a method termed &quot;cold brew&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/search?q=Cold%20brew&quot;&gt;discussed on this site&lt;/a&gt; as well. By the same rules as explained before, this means you need significantly longer extraction times (we are talking &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; here) and should expect a different taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Very few people will be extreme critics of the quality of your coffee and depending on where you wish to be located you may be targeting the busy commuter that pops in to get his fix, or the chill artist that wants a relaxing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Target your local area and find out what people like and what ideal direction you want your coffee shop to be going in i.e. do you want to open more stores elsewhere?

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are at least three ways to reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way is to roast the beans more, to a dark level. I think that is the main way if you want to stick with your beans. This is inline with &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2570/how-best-to-reduce-tannins-in-black-coffee/2571#2571&quot;&gt;MT San's comment and related answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second way is to play with the speed of dripping. The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be other ways, but I have no other experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Later...&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to &quot;drip-brew&quot;, so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results. And warming up the result leads to yet again different flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, drinks are less acid with coffee brew. I do not use a wide range of beans, so please keep in mind that this claim may depend on the species. Also, the roast level leads to different results---exactly as a hot-water drip does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold brew emphasizes &quot;green&quot; or &quot;herbal&quot; notes, though. It is, I believe, worth a try as acidity is different, but it is yet different from &quot;usual coffee drinks&quot;. Well, production is hard too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The process of compressing the coffee powder in a portafilter of an espresso machine before pulling the shot is called &lt;strong&gt;tamping&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents &lt;strong&gt;channelling&lt;/strong&gt;, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Change your beans. In my experience, lighter roasts cause more resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Options two and three are only listed for the sake of completeness - normally the tamper force is adapted to the other variables, and not the other way around. A good espresso making tutorial should give you a starting point on how to find the correct tamping force and grind coarseness level for your combination of beans and machine. Also, if you own an espresso machine and never heard of tamping, you may want to read one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A well sourced coffee that has been properly roasted and brewed can be amazingly sweet. It's not the same kind of sweetness of cane sugar, but maybe milk is a better example. Milk is not entirely sweet when cold, but as soon as you heat it to around 130F, it's turns deliciously sweet. &#xA;In any event, you will want a lighter roasted coffee. I think it can be a strange transition for people's pallets, especially for people that have been drinking a darker roasted coffee their whole lives, it becomes hard to identify a light coffee with the &quot;coffee taste.&quot; A lighter roasted coffee preserves the sugars within the coffee, and brings out the wonderful acids and flavors that come from the fact that coffee is indeed the seed of a fruit. &#xA;I think if I was you, I would purchase some coffee from a specialty coffee roaster (like: verve, ritual, 49 parallel, Intelligencia) and see if one of them really amazes you in any way, and then try and achieve that same roast profile. Other then that, don't always take those taste profiles to heart! They can certainly be different for anyone, and some often pretty silly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Our CoffeeTeam GS died after 12 years of daily operation and we purchased an CoffeeTeam Pro from Sur La Table.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience, I can say that stirring does not affect the brewing process in a French press a lot. The initial stirring is just for homogenously distributing the grounds in the water. Then, the rest of brewing happens itself in the water by chemical extraction itself and the main factors are time and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to your question, I can say that you may be over extracting if you are waiting for the water to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One quick recipe and other related discussion are mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2717/what-is-the-recommended-coffee-bean-to-water-ratio-for-drip-brewing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by improve? French press is one of the most popular brewing methods in the world, and rightly so: it's dead easy to operate and produces a great cup of coffee. The mechanism is very simple and easy to clean, a good french-press pot will last years if not decades, and if any part of it breaks it's cheap and easy to replace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What improvements might you make in general? Control over the brew is probably the most important, and with French press is there really anything you could add? The plunger separates the grounds and the coffee very effectively in a good pot, so not much room for innovation there. The other main variables: grind and timing are beyond the scope of the actual pot. In terms of maintenance and ease of use, the pot is optimal already too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could argue that the Aeropress &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an improved French press, since the brewing method is similar, especially if you use a metal filter. But it's more of a faff to use, doesn't scale so well (you can get 12-cup Cafetières), and tailored much more to the coffee enthusiast than the average person who just wants a cup of what the know and like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; A cafetière is already optimal for making French press, there's no room for significant innovation, beyond inventing new ways to brew coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Volumetrically, instant coffee is usually on the order of 5-10 mL (1-2 tsp) coffee powder per cup, and this sounds like it's about the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest starting with 150mL / 5 fl. oz. and try it. Add more water as necessary. Or, in the event that you like it even stronger, use less water next time.

Grind a bit more coffee. If you went in the correct direction (finer or coarser), determine whether you'd like it finer or coarser. (Start over if you went in the wrong direction)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Change the setting by going N ÷ 2 (e.g., 2) steps in that direction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the grind and check. Terminate if you're happy, or go one step at a time until you are happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MARK THIS SETTING&lt;/strong&gt; AND HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE IT&lt;/em&gt; ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I have a similar Hario model (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/hand-grinder/ceramic-grinder-skerton.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), which sounds marginally &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult to adjust than the one you're talking about. I use mine for almost all of my daily coffee grinding. I set it very infrequently: I go through phases between pour-over and moka, and I try not to go through these phases more than once per month to avoid adjusting this thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To adjust my model:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove top nut.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove crank handle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove setting bracket.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twist the toothed, threaded washer/nut about the threaded shaft to move the nut up (counter-clock, coarser grind) or down (clock-wise, finer grind).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Replace bracket, handle, top nut.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mark the &quot;set-screw&quot; nut with a marker to remember where I've tried. I try to avoid going more than one revolution either way; on mine, two revolutions goes from moka-fine powder to French-press coarseness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you've figured it out...&lt;/strong&gt; I have put scratch &quot;marks&quot; on the screw for I (moka: fine), II (drip: medium), III (French press: coarse) so that I don't have to guess quite as much. Highly recommend indelible marks on your grinder once you find the setting you like. To change from one setting to the other, adjust to the middle: then go tighter to the &quot;fine&quot; setting, and looser to the &quot;coarse&quot; setting (otherwise, it can be ambiguous).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than changing the settings, I like the thing.

You also want to be able to use the steam wands while extracting, so the need for each group to have a double boiler is pretty big.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of one machine that costs a ton, you can get two machines (each with one group and a double boiler) that cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500 instead. Try not to go with home appliances - even though I have nothing but great things to say about Breville, they &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; designed for that kind of continuous duty cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is not all that's important, you need to be able to make more than one drink at a time :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;At least two burr grinders with dose control&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dose control gives you consistency. And you need to be able to grind as many beans as you plan to offer without cleaning grinders each time. These can get insanely expensive as you get into features like auto tamping - the biggest thing to look for is accurate dose control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend a model that fires once you stick a portafilter under it, with a button to extract into a pitcher. They &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; come with a small stand to tamp, if not, grab some of them (if not auto-tamping).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Refrigeration&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't recommend using a cooler with ice for dairy - it's going to start off as too cold and work its way up to being too warm. A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Misc Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be blending stuff, get a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; blender that can eat through ice easily. Another thing that's nice to have two of in case one breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget, you need to be able to wash your hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Sanitizer is good, but having a basin and bucket is also helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, don't forget whack-buckets, trash cans, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ticket Handling System&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is really important. Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Water&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water. You'll also need to make sure it's possible to get that water into the coffee machines easily :) Transporting that much water can be a challenge because it can get so heavy that applying the breaks in a normal vehicle takes on a whole new dynamic. Got a place that delivers it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad. If you're going to offer cakes and snacks, have a way to keep them fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Menu Items&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep it simple and keep it confined to what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can make consistently well. Tell people they're welcome to ask, but avoid anything super complicated from becoming a permanent fixture on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Cost your drinks&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should charge 3x your cost to be safe, 2 - 2.5x if you want or need to be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; competitive. 3x is pretty certain to cover your costs, overhead, and profit. You need to know how much it costs you to make every single thing, how much it costs to just open and tear down, and everything else. Another great reason for keeping a simple (10 things is good) menu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The coffee fruit is full of sugar and fermentation starts rapidly after the fruit leaves the tree. Thus, peeling of the fruit from the bean rapidly may help to get rid of the mold risk. If you choose to get the fruity tastes affect your bean and leave the fruit around your bean, then you should take proper care about mold and fungi. This may be especially difficult in big plantations as you need around 20 days and huge flat areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet process&lt;/strong&gt; can be said the industry standard. The fruit is &lt;em&gt;totally peeled off to the bean&lt;/em&gt;, then the beans are dried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.a. &lt;strong&gt;Double-washed process&lt;/strong&gt; is a process that the fruits are first washed to the bean. After the fermentation starts, it is washed for a second (or several) times. This technique is also known as &lt;em&gt;Kenyan process&lt;/em&gt;. The result is a very clean flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;dry process&lt;/strong&gt;, the fruits are left intact to dry themselves. During this process, they should be moved regularly to protect them from mold and fungus. When the humidity is around 13%, they are peeled of, washed and dried for the second round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Semi-dry/semi-washed/pulped-natural/honey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;just the skin of the fruit&lt;/em&gt; is peeled of, but the meaty part is left on the bean. Then, the fruit is dried, peeled of to the bean, washed and dried for the second round.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3.a. In &lt;strong&gt;50% washed&lt;/strong&gt; processing method is the method where the processing is akin to honey method, but the meaty part of the fruit is peeled of halfway to the bean. This peeling of may be done in the beginning or sometime during the fermentation. As mentioned, the aim is balancing the sugar level and protecting the beans from mold, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that &lt;strong&gt;pulp-natural&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;dry&lt;/strong&gt; processing are costlier than &lt;strong&gt;wet&lt;/strong&gt; processing -whatever the metric is; monetary, labor or time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor is flavor. &lt;strong&gt;Dry&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;pulp-natural&lt;/strong&gt; processed beans include more fruity notes as the fruit fermented together with the bean during the first drying phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(It is said that pulp-natural beans are less acidic than dry beans, but I have not experience that myself.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that, dry or pulp-natural processing is not available everywhere. E.g. if you see a bag of Guatemala dry processed beans*, just run away. As Guatemalan weather is so humid, you can hardly dry process the fruit without mold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(*) Probably, it doesn't even exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/coffee-processing-differences-ethiopia-what-is-dry-vs-washed-coffees-ethiopia-kenya-costa-rica-brazil.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Further reading&lt;/a&gt; that matches origins and processing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

There is an entire industry surrounding this.  What you really need to ask is what you are trying to accomplish by adding something and find the best ingredient for your needs.  Low or no calories flavoring agents maybe suited if you are just not into the taste of coffee.  If you are looking for a fat calorie source, experimenting with different oils until you find one that fits your needs and has a flavor you can deal with may be the way to go.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I look for more protein and not as much fat in my diet.

In these brewing methods, fines, the smaller coffee particles produce the majority of the problem in extraction and off-flavours produced in the end cup. With filter brewing, it restricts water flow and can cause inconsistencies in the extraction. With french press, the fines can overextract due to the full immersion process and cause a lot more bitter flavours to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Filtering out inconsistent coffee grounds results in a much more evenly extracted coffee as the majority of grounds will extract more uniformly without any under or over extracting much more than the rest. This should give a much more balanced and bodied cup assuming other variables are as diligently controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Better grinders can minimise fines but an extra step can ensure particle size consistency. However I'm not sure about the extent of adverse effects of exposing ground coffee to air for so long would be to which I would suggest minimising grounds-sifting time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think this discussion should start with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Maillard reaction&lt;/a&gt;; known as caramelization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the beans are roasted, a chemical reaction activated by heat reduce sugars (more correctly, hydrocarbons) within the beans with the proteins (more correctly, amino acids). During this time, some carbon dioxide is emitted as a result of this process and jailed within the cell structure. During this reaction, many organic molecules within the bean are pyrolysed (chemically separated by fire). Probably at that phase, many aromatic lipids emerge that we are actually tasting and trying to extract during brewing. Note that, more fruity aromas were already in the bean before pyrolysis (or caramelization, Maillard reaction, roasting... You may use interchangeably).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's reason about under- and over- roasted beans:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;under-roasted beans&lt;/strong&gt;, you have less carbon dioxide. So you have less foam. You have less aromatic lipids, so you have less aroma. But the overall aroma is more fruity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;over-roasted beans&lt;/strong&gt;, you have so much carbon dioxide. So the cup will sure have a foam. You have aromatic lipids, but probably you have burnt some of the fragile organic molecules on the road. Thus you have a lot of aroma, but the overall aroma will be a bit burnt and bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I realized that @Geo already explained the Maillard reaction very neatly in a previous answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/quantifying-flavor-differences-between-varieties/2550#2550&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

In theory, it is possible to super-heat any liquid with polar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature of an object is defined by the total kinetic energy of its molecules. The kinetic energy has two sources, the linear velocity of molecules, and spin of molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microwave ovens heat up objects by adding &lt;em&gt;spin&lt;/em&gt; to the molecules of an object. Roughly speaking, molecules stay where they are, but spin around very rapidly under microwave to heat up. &lt;em&gt;During this phase, they cannot find a way to vaporize (linear velocity).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When your friend take the cup out of the oven, the molecules are not under the effect of microwave (so they don't spin) anymore, so they find their way out to vaporize, and choose to vaporize (linear velocity) very quickly. That occurs as an explosion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

But that is not to say that a conical grinder like the Mazzer Kony /Robur is not a superb grinder just because it's flat disc burr brethren vastly outnumber it.

Quite the opposite in well established by myriad reputable sources and can be seen in plots of particle size distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flat (non burr) disc grinder crushes /fractures coffee beans in a less predictable manner than precision burrs that have a more consistent and more sharply delineated size reduction path.

Still, these scratches do not affect the performance of the gadget if they are not large enough to leak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to clean the grounds is rubbing the surface of the rubber ring by your finger under warm water for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; After I see the photos, my guess is, these scars are caused by the scratches first, then the polished surface of the plastic is peeled off by heat.

This then leads to the facts that for espresso coffee, carbon dioxide has to be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;generated by roasting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;maintained in the bean by proper packaging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;maintained in the ground coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;solubilized in water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;released into the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this framework statements such as “any error in grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color, the texture and the persistence of the foam” or “the foam is the signature of a well-prepared espresso” can be well justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content originally present in the coffee. In addition to the importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore; you need to find fresh nice Arabica beans, roast properly, degas for the correct amount of time, grind them well, brew appropriately with decent water right after grinding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2494/what-is-the-difference-between-the-terms-percolation-and-brewing-in-english&quot;&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; for the use of the &lt;strong&gt;percolation&lt;/strong&gt; in scientific papers.

You can buy an inexpensive electric rotary grinder that will be adequate for most purposes -- one example &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00006IUX5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use it for grinding spices or seeds. If you already have one, you will get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; odor holdover from one grinding mission to the next, but it's probably fine if you're not very picky. 10-15 quid new, or even cheaper used from a thrift shop etc. You can even mash them up with mortar and pestle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some brewing mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. The cheapest and simplest are probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;drip brew&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., pour-over or auto-drip), but I online a few more down below. Your options are manual pour-over (my recommendation) or auto-drip:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual pour-over&lt;/strong&gt;. My pick would be a manual pour-over coffee cone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0014CVEH6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;such as this one&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic cone holder for like 5 quid. You put the cone over a mug, put in a paper filter, add medium-grind coffee (even as fine as the rotary grinder will give you will be okay), and slowly pour water over the top until brewed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-drip&lt;/strong&gt;. You can find a really cheap auto-drip machine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001NXC5YC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;for instance this one from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, for like 10-15 quid, or even cheaper used.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You're mis-interpreting the significance of the results in the cited experiment. There were also statistically controlled follow up experiments (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/tgp-ii-particle-distribution-analysis-of-grinder-adjustments-interim-results-t15698.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that studied grinder particle size distribution in more detail on the same site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consequently even when very precise uni-modal particle size regulation is achieved as is the case with industrial roller miller grinders, particle sizes must be deliberately blended for espresso grinds to achieve the required bi-modal distribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This bi-modal size distribution is crucial for proper espresso extraction where the coffee bed (espresso puck) is subject to approx 10 bar water pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your intent in asking for grinder recommendations capable of producing small particle sizes appears to be based on the mistaken assumption that this is the normal working range for grinders. It is not. A good espresso grinder needs to have a well-defined bi-modal distribution with the largest volume of coarse (approx 500u)  and a smaller volume of fine (approx 50u) particles. And a bulk (brewed coffee) grinder should have a tighter unimodal distribution and a working range of about 100 - 1000u. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first plot above is the particle size distribution by volume in the OP cited experiment showing the characteristic espresso grinder bi-modal curve with average particle size peaks at approximately 500u and 50u. The second graph shows the bi-modal distribution for a Robur espresso grinder from a subsequent experiment (TGPII, Robur). And the third graph shows a high resolution plot from a instrumentation manufacturer (Sympatec).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to the specific grinders that the OP was considering, all three are well known and respected commercial espresso grinders. FWIW, large conical grinders are easier to use and produce more consistent results. But all would work well for espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UxEY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UxEY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Espresso shot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Why these things matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High quality bulk coffee grinders by contrast show a tighter, uni-modal size distribution at the selected size. The usual working range for brewed coffee is about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ditting.com/suggested_settings.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;100u - 900u&lt;/a&gt; (Turkish - French press).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;the ground coffee particle size after being placed in water was about&#xA;  10 micron (in diameter) on average&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;10u can only be said to be the average particle size &lt;em&gt;by count&lt;/em&gt;. It must be noted however that the proportion of 10u particles by volume is minuscule. A meaningful characterization of average particle size needs to be done by volume or distribution, the former has a strong correlation with expert taste tests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I recently checked at a German Starbucks what milk they have to pour into filter coffee, and they start at 1.5% fat. Note that even if the label on a box of milk says 0% fat, there will always be some traces of fat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether it tastes well: that is subjective.

Whether you will actually be able to get a close-to-0% fat Cafe Latte depends on the place that you are visiting: not all coffee places may have that type of milk in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="How to prevent Bonavita 1900 TS drip-brewer from producing bitter flavored coffee?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My family bought me a Bonavita 1900 TS for Father's day. Unfortunately after burning through 3/4 of a bag of coffee, I still haven't produced a good tasting carafe of coffee. Every time, it comes out (varying levels, but still) bitter and dry. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried grinding (with my Capresso Infinity) in the exact middle setting and worked my way all the way to the most coarse setting under coarse. Can still go further, but I have a feeling I'm missing something. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm using BJ's Kona blend Arabica, medium roast. Yeah, not the highest grade stuff. But I like it good enough from my old 12 cup Cuisinart at 6 scoops with 12 cups of water (per the coffeemaker measurement). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've tried anywhere from 55-65g of grounds with 1L of water in the Bonavita. Which is way more grounds than I used to use in my old Cuisinart, but I'm trying to follow recommendations I've found online.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have the Bonavita BV1900TS brewer with a Baratza Preciso grinder.  I actually have two sets, one for work and one for home.  I have pre-infusion enabled, if that matters in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also have a VST refractometer that can measure the brewed coffee to determine its strength and also derive if it is too bitter or not.  I have been able to get good results out of the Bonavita.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only say that once I started measuring the coffee I have moved to coarser grind that what was originally recommended.   You have said you have tried coarse so I'm not sure what the issue might be.  I would maybe try to readjust your grinder by adjusting while it is running and empty.  Turn it all the way to fine and then open it back up to as coarse as you can make it, while the grinder is running.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been using 40g of coffee with 700ml of water in, so maybe give that a try with the coarse grounds just to see if you can make it not taste bitter.  You might also try one other type of fresh beans as another data point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My friend had the Capresso Infinity and it left a lot of grinds in it, so you might want to tilt it and tap out some of the old grinds before you adjust it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You were most likely right in saying 'no' straight out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is considered organic if no chemical substances were used for its production. This includes herbicides, pesticides, and I believe some fertilizers too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; agrees with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even if you're a coffee producer and you're sure you don't use chemical substances and there are no residues in the soil, that's not enough. You have to &lt;strong&gt;certify&lt;/strong&gt; your product and you'll be able to say that your coffee is &lt;em&gt;certified organic&lt;/em&gt;. The certification process and agency will depend on where the coffee is grown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the certification costs. And some producers might not afford it (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/76/chris-in-ak&quot;&gt;Chris_in_AK&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you're only roasting the beans and not producing them, it's not really up to you (you could ask your provider if the beans they're selling you are certified organic). But you could buy beans that are certified organic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

For a Rift Valley bean which default profile seems to work the best, and should I generally try to go longer or shorter after the first crack?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should mention I am cooling the beans rapidly by opening the door when I end the roast and force air into the roaster with an electric leaf blower. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit #2: I am waiting 24hrs before cupping.

First, higher temperatures generally increase the solubility of &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; compounds. Higher temperature water generally means more of everything gets dissolved, good and bad.Using cold water doesn't entirely solve the problem, since the lower solubility can leave a lot of great flavors behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Higher temperature can cause the breakdown of proteins, but I would doubt this is a significant source.After all, the beans were already roasted at high temperature before you ever got to the brewing part and the majority of the breakdown probably happened there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think you've got the right idea with circulating water at some intermediate temperature; you'd probably get the best of both cold and hot brew after you play with the temperatures a bit to find the best one for your tastes. The lower the temperature, the more flavors left behind and the longer you may have to brew to get to an adequate strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to try it, let us know how it works!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a Breville Infuser espresso machine as well as a Breville Smart Grinder Pro. The espresso machine comes with two types of filters (for singles and doubles), and can dispense a pre-programmed volume of water corresponding to a single or double dose through its two front buttons (the machine also allows programming these volumes, if desired.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus there are 4 combinations of coffee I could produce:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose (~30 ml, as I understand).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose (~60 ml, as I understand).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are any of these 4 cases not usual or &quot;recommended&quot;? Particularly I never brew the combination corresponding to case 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the expected flavor profile of the espresso produced in each of these cases (more/less acid, sour, sweet, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which of these could be called a ristretto, normale, or lungo?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What parameters should I aim for in each of these cases, in terms of: mass of grounds in the filter before brewing (in g), shot volume (in ml) or mass (in g) in the cup, and extraction time (in s)? I have heard extraction times should be always 25 s regardless of the coffee dose and the volume of water, so 25 s for all combinations above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This machine has a pressure gauge, indicating water pressure during extraction. Should I watch for a particular value in this gauge, or ignore it and just watch the extraction time? Currently my procedure for adjusting the grind is to make it coarser when pressure is in the upper 2/3rds of the gauge range, and finer when pressure is in the lower 1/3rd of the gauge range. I do not regularly monitor extraction time for adjusting the grind. Using combination 4, and adjusting the grind such that the pressure gauge stays close to the midpoint, extraction times are in the range of 25-30 s. However, using the same grind settings but dosing enough water for a single (combination 2), extraction times are closer to 15 s. To get closer to 25 s I would have to let the pressure gauge reach values way into the upper range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closing: although I enjoy the taste of combination 2, it appears most of the water stays in the coffee puck, and the volume actually dispensed in the cup is very small (about 15-20 ml). Perhaps I should reprogram the water volume to get something closer to, say, 30 ml? Would this help me get an extraction time closer to 25 s for this dose (assuming this is the &quot;ideal&quot; extraction time)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Therefore, 25 seconds for a 30 ml cup is quite normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tamping&lt;/strong&gt; is done around 20 kgf downward force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The temperature&lt;/strong&gt; must be in between 92 and 94 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pressure&lt;/strong&gt; is expected to be 7 to 11 bar, where possible.

The most popular lab synthesis (1,3-dimethylurea and ethyl 2-cyanoacetate) requires multiple steps, and generally more steps means more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is a huge demand for decaffeinated coffee. The bonus is exactly as you expected; these processes generate both decaf coffee and caffeine as a by-product, that can then be repackaged or sold in other products.&#xA;Historically, decaffeination was done with organic solvent extraction (chloroform and dichloromethane being really common), but today is is usually done with the swiss water process (I suspect this is what ends up in pills and added caffeine consumer goods) or supercritical fluid extraction (which is more energy intensive, but can lead to a higher quality product that is often purchased by laboratories and scientific researchers who use it as part of their experiments).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  Is there any science or data to support coffee that has undergone longer roast cycles needing less rest/degas time?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some time, I have been doing my own roasting by cranking the machine to max temp, letting it rip, then stopping the roast when I am just short of my desired target and letting it coast to finish in the cool down cycle.  For almost all varietals of beans, my target roast levels end up in the 14:30 to 16:00 minute range for a half pound of green coffee beans.  Recently, however, I have been experimenting with significantly longer roasts (~30% to 50% longer).  I set the machine to max (482F) let it run 12 minutes or so, then crank it down to 425F or so and run to just short of target.  Generally this has been adding 4 to 8 minutes to my roasts times.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The obvious disadvantage is the extra time it takes me to be involved with the roast.  The advantage I was going for was that it is much easier to hit a target roast with such a long window at the &quot;end of roast&quot;.  However, I seem to notice another potential advantage.  The coffee seems to taste much better after much shorter rest times.  With my old shorter method coffees came into their peak seemingly around 72 to 96 hours later.  With this new method, the coffee seems to be hitting that same stride at 24 or 48 hours.  This is anecdotally supported by the fact that the air tight jars I keep my beans in are noticeably less &quot;poppy&quot; when I open them to degas the day after roasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can think of several reasons why this may be a thing, most just involving equations for the behaviors of gasses at various temperatures, but does anyone have a more solid reason why this might be?  Or evidence that's it's all in my head (or taste buds) and just bunk?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have been buying de Longhi coffee machines for a while now and they seem to be getting worse.  I started on a Delonghi EC152 which was low cost and pretty reliable.  Then when my 2nd one died, I tried to order a replacement but it had been discontinued and so equivalent model was a EC146.B which was really poor.  As luck would have it, or so I thought, I received another de Longhi as a present, an EC 270.  But this leaks like crazy after only a few weeks.  If you fiddle with the valve on the  water vessel it stops leaking for a few  hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would like to buy a coffee maker which doesn't leak and which will last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Willing to spend a reasonable amount to get something that will last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a home use machine for say 1-2 cups per day.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I like my French Press is because of the caffeine boost. One simple answer to your question is to add more coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But aside from the type and amount of coffee used there are several things that will influence the caffeine level of your coffee. One of them is the size of the ground. You need a ground big enough that it is filtered out but not so big that the water doesn't completely extract the oils and caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might try different grind levels and see which one works best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do is increase steep time. If your grinds are just a bit too large perhaps a 6 minute steep would work better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will have to experiment with the grind and steep time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Two interesting things are what looks like a plug to seal the pour spout in the center ring to hold in the pressure and something I haven't seen is a sealed top vessel that has what looks like a whistle to the right of the lid.  I guess that is to let the person know when the water is completely in the upper chamber and the coffee has started to steep and to turn off the heat so the bottom vessel can cool drawing the brewed coffee into the bottom vessel.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between end of first crack and the start of second crack can be very tricky. A lot has to do with the variety of beans being roasted and your heat application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I think happened to you was that you lost control of your heat. At first crack your beans become exothermic (give off heat) and you didn't reduce your heat. What happened then is that you had too much heat at raced through the &quot;development&quot; time in your roast profile. &#xA;To correct this you should reduce your heat at the start of first crack and develop the flavor by how much/long  you let the beans go for before taking them off the heat.&#xA;This is a critical time for your roast because your are developing the flavor in your roast by time and roast level. How you apply heat changes from variety to variety and darkness. &#xA;Take the time to read up on roasting theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a good basic guide: &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeforum.org.au/roasting-how-to-do-it/a-basic-roast-profile-guide-for-home-coffee-roasters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A basic roast profile guide for home coffee roasters.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This is just a guess, but I suppose using a non-sealed container would speed up oxidation and deterioration of the coffee due to continuous exposure to atmospheric oxygen, just as storing the dry beans in an open container would. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, from my own experience, 12 to 24 hours of such exposure would not yield a perceptibly different taste. What's more important is that you store the finished product in a sealed container, preferably with as little air as possible (I use a water bottle). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, also in my experience, cold-brewing with a french press is more convenient, since one can simply push down the plunger and pour the finished product as opposed to lengthy fumbling with filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This question is actually answered on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website of the coffee producer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the roasting process of coffee produces carbon dioxide inside the beans, which takes a while to find its way out. Sealing the coffee in tight containers would be problematic, as the carbon dioxide would stay in the beans in this way (making the coffee sour) or may let the bag burst over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, not sealing coffee bags is not a solution either, as exposure to air lets the coffee get stale after a while. As supermarket coffee is unfortunately often stored for long period of time before sold, this would be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the solution is to either (1) use a one-way valve that allows the carbon dioxide to escape from the bag without the air coming into the bag, or (2) to let the beans degas before sealing them airtight in bags. Solution (1) is probably best for fresh coffee, so it is used here. I don't know what problem is solved with such valves in pet food containers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Now I drink a dark-roasted fresh-grind coffee using a pour-over brewing method. Eventually you discover incomparable aromas and flavors in different coffee bean sources. Additionally, I add a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Of course, you can try removing all additives and go to completely black. It depends on your flavor palette.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are many, many, many types. In order to give a good overview, some background knowledge is useful. What all types of coffee have in common is that all are produced from the pits of coffee cherries, the fruits borne by trees in the genus coffea (coffee beans are technically seeds of these trees, not beans). Coffee cherries are harvested from coffee trees, the pits are removed and processed, producing green coffee beans. These are then roasted, ground, and brewed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can vary on any of the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bean Variety -&lt;/strong&gt; There are two major bean varieties of coffee: arabica and robusta. Arabica coffees are more ubiquitous and generally regarded as superior in quality to robusta coffees. If you are buying coffee from a coffee shop, ordering it at a restaurant, or brewing it at home, there is a very good chance you are drinking an arabica variety. Robusta is easier to grow and a less temperamental crop than arabica, contains quite a bit more caffeine, and generally is poorer quality than arabica. Robusta varieties are often used in instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing Method -&lt;/strong&gt; There are two major processing types for green coffee beans: washed and unwashed. Washed coffees remove the cherry before the bean is left to dry, while unwashed coffees have their beans removed from the cherries after drying. Unwashed coffees often come from Africa and Indonesia and have richer, earthier flavors, while washed coffees often come from Latin America, and are smoother and fruitier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Origin -&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most important factors, as coffee flavors vary greatly with geography, climate, and soil composition. For example, Ethopian coffees tend to be rich, full-bodied, and wine-like, Hawaiian coffees like Kona tend to be more acidic (flavor term, not pH), and Latin American coffees tend to be more medium bodied, fruity, and floral.&#xA;Roast - Roasting is a complex process that can produce varying degrees of flavor and caffeine content. Roasts levels can include light/half-city, medium/full-city, full (Viennese/Italian), and double (French), in order of increasing boldness. Contrary to popular opinion, lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than darker roasts. A good illustration of the process can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing method -&lt;/strong&gt; Can include drip filter, french press, percolated, espresso, or other methods. Brewing method also makes a big difference, with coffee aficionados generally preferring french press and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most expensive type of coffee is Kopi Luwak from Sumatra, Bali, Java, and Sulawesi. Kopi Luwak roughly translates to &quot;civet coffee&quot; in English, and is called such because the beans are harvested from the droppings of civets (a cat-like mammal from Indonesia). The beans are supposedly of superior quality because the civets choose only the ripest coffee beans to eat from coffee trees, and are processed in a unique way by the civets digestive tract. Kopi Luwak often sells for around $300/lb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following are the different types of coffee drinks that you may find in a cafe that prepares coffee using the espresso coffee making method:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affogato-&lt;/strong&gt; This is a term that literally means 'drowned'. It is the description of a shot of separately served espresso that is later poured over a the top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato. This beverage is usually served in a short drink glass and is a Italian desert favourite. Popular Affogatos include Vanilla Affogato, Mocha Affogato, and Peppermint Affogato.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americano-&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as &quot;Lungo&quot; or &quot;Long Black&quot; and made by diluting 1-2 shots of espresso with hot water in order to approximate the texture, flavor and body of an American-style drip coffee. Said to have been originally devised as a sort of insult to Americans who wanted their Italian espresso diluted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babycino-&lt;/strong&gt; A cappuccino styled drink served in an up-market café typically for children. It consists of warm milk in a small cup and topped with milk froth and chocolate powder. No espresso coffee essence is added.&#xA;Breve: A term in Italian that means short and is used to describe an espresso coffee drink made with a half-and-half light cream or semi-skim milk instead of full fat milk&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffe' Freddo-&lt;/strong&gt; Chilled, sweetened espresso served in a tall glass, often on ice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffe Latte or “Latte”-&lt;/strong&gt; A ‘premium milk coffee experience’. Freshly steamed milk without foam served in a tall glass with a shot of espresso coffee.&#xA;Caffe Mocha: A combination of chocolate syrup and a shot of espresso, topped with steamed milk and a layer of micro-foam. Finished with a sprinkled of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappuccino Chiaro-&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA Wet or Light cappuccino): Cappuccino prepared with more milk than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappuccino Scuro-&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA Dry or Dark cappuccino) Cappuccino prepared with less milk than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappuccino: “Cap”-&lt;/strong&gt;  A ‘traditional morning heart starter’. Steamed foamed velvety milk poured over one shot (1) of coffee oil extract made from 12gm of freshly ground beans producing 38ml of essence. Finished by topping with foam and a sprinkle of chocolate powder. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con panna-&lt;/strong&gt; Like the beverage &quot;macchiato&quot;, but whipped cream is substituted for steamed milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortado-&lt;/strong&gt; means &quot;cut&quot; in Spanish so the double shot espresso served in a demetesse glass supported with a metal handle is &quot;cut&quot; with an equal part of hot milk, making it in between the size and strength of a macchiato and a cappuccino. It is popular in Spain and Portugal, as well as throughout Latin America and Cuba, where it is drunk in the afternoon. Variations include more froth on top than a traditional cortado and occasionally with different names such as Piccolo or Gibraltar.

As Kris Rosvold explains in the comments: In Oregon, the hammerhead is usually known as a red eye and uses 2 shots of espresso topped up in a 16oz travel mug with drip coffee. It's also sometimes called a &quot;shot in the dark&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irish Coffee-&lt;/strong&gt; Coffee mixed with a dash of Irish whiskey and served with cream on top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latte Macchiato-&lt;/strong&gt; Steamed milk served in a tall glass rather than a cup that is “stained” by a shot of espresso coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Black-&lt;/strong&gt; Often called the “American”.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There may be some advice on this. My first will be to check the pressure as you can do this with your pretty machine. Please check if you are around 9 bars when pulling the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason of delay is, it takes a while for the water to wet the grounds. So, it is normal to wait for a few seconds to see the first drops. However; if it is more than a few seconds, the most possible problems I can think of are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The pressure is not enough&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You have tamped so forcefully&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The grind is too fine&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'll give some background, a hypothesis, and (more important) instructions to find out experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experiment is easy and fun. I did experiments such as paper vs. bamboo filter, slightly different grind sizes, fresh beans vs. 7-weeks off roast, and different coffee:water ratios within the range of a scoop measurement (i.e. is it important to weigh the coffee?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lady tasting tea experiment&lt;/a&gt; is at the start of modern statistics and randomized trials. (There's now a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized-ebook/dp/B00633W4A2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century&lt;/a&gt;.) The question was, “Does it matter to add tea to milk vs. milk to tea?” It turns out the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculation and Hypothesis:&lt;/strong&gt; Adding milk to tea lets significantly more milk get hotter than adding tea to milk does. That could enable more of it to react chemically, e.g. curdling. But that's unlikely with ice, so I'll bet adding ice to hot coffee vs. hot coffee to ice makes no discernable difference in taste. (Let's ignore the fact that dropping ice into hot coffee could splash out more hot coffee than the reverse.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Experiment:&lt;/strong&gt; Do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/pages/triangle%20test.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Triangle Test&lt;/a&gt; with 3 or more people. Make the iced coffee both ways, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, keeping all other variables as constant as you can. Each person gets 3 cups, one of which is different than the other two, e.g. a sequence like A-B-A or B-B-A. Give a different random combination to each taster, of course without revealing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All tasters should start by tasting their 3 cups in order. Then they can go back and forth between cups as much as they like. Their job is to try to discern the difference and say which of the 3 cups tastes the most different. You might also ask them to state their preference. When they all make their choices, then you can reveal the combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math is Not Hard:&lt;/strong&gt; If a taster gets it right, we really don't know if they were lucky or good. The default explanation (&quot;null hypothesis&quot;) for the combined test results is that they're within a reasonable range of random results. Dice would randomly get 1/3 of the choices right. If enough people got it right that the odds were &lt;em&gt;small enough&lt;/em&gt; of dice getting a result that extreme or better, then we'll conclude the tasters can discern the difference. Different fields of science may use different thresholds. Pick a threshold before doing the experiment. A common standard for &quot;statistical significance&quot; is ≤ 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 3 tasters, if they all get it right, that's a 1/(3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1/27 = 3.7% chance, which beats the 5% threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; tasters get it right, the calculation considers the number of ways to get &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; correct choices and the probability of each random choice being correct (1/3).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Google Sheets formula for Probability{x ≥ K of N correct choices} is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=1 - BINOMDIST(K - 1, N, 1/3, TRUE)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so if that value is ≤ 5%, we'll conclude that people can reliably taste the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; To prepare for an experiment, I make paper strips with the different test sequences. Whoever pours for taster &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; will pick a strip at random, pour those cups while out of view, stash the strip in a pocket, and bring it out after everyone has written down their tasting choices. There needs to be at least enough strips for the number of tasters, and usually a multiple of 6 strips since there are 6 possible sequences. But when there are only 3 tasters, I prune it to 2 sequences that have one A and two B's and 2 sequences that have one B and two A's, so we can't all get the same odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Each taster gets 3 cups of coffee, a spit cup, water, crackers, and a napkin. I put painter's tape on the coffee cups to mark consistent fill lines and to label them 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This grinder has allows for a grind amounts in increments of &quot;2 coffee cups&quot; starting from 4 cups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My coffee did not become watery upon first use of the DBM-8. I usually brew using 16 to 20 fluid oz of water, and I have switched between the 4-cup and the 6-cup setting on the grinder. I found that the 6-cup setting tasted pretty good, but seemed to use up a lot of beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, what has happened for the past week is that coffee made using my brewer has been tasting watery, no matter if I use the 4-cup or the 6-cup grind setting, and whether I try more or less water. I have set the coarseness of the grind to medium, which I believe is appropriate. All I am getting is colored hot water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I inspect the coffee filter and the grounds after brewing with the 6-cup grind, I observe a portion of the coffee grounds appear dry on top, although beneath that, the coffee grounds appear wet. It's as if the hot water is going directly through the filter without soaking enough in the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is my coffee maker broken? I tried cleaning with diluted vinegar, but this did not change things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it the beans? I do switch around, but the beans I buy are in the 10-20$ range per pound.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Well this is a strange problem but it seems to have to do with the new grinder you are using or the way you use it since the grind is the only variable that has changed (according to your story).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watery coffee most often means that you don't use enough ground coffee. Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered. In theory the water should then distribute much more evenly through the grounds. I'd suggest you do this only &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; you have solved the general problem as a means to improve the flavor. It'd definitely be a quite &quot;hacky&quot; solution and I think first of all your machine should work the way it is supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If I did that would it be more valuable to look at this exhaust temperature?

I built a home roaster about a year ago using equipment from RK Drums, which requires a dedicated gas grill. I'm really happy with the results I get from this setup. I noticed the Kaldi also requires the purchase of a gas burner but what size and form is it? I use a single thermocouple that mounts very close (~1/2&quot;) to the drum. I'm not sure how you plan to drop one right in the bean mass while the drum is rotating. Again I'm not very familiar with the Kaldi so maybe you've worked this out. Using forced air might help if you think the beans aren't getting even temp distribution. I don't use forced air. The thermal mass of the grill cavity along with the bean rotation seems to distribute the temperate quite evenly. Wherever you place the probe, as long as you can get a consistent and reliable reading you should be able to build your roast profiles accordingly. Good luck and I look forward to your updates with the results!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The two big numbers I use when brewing are ratio and time. With these set correctly, you can do batches from 1L to 25L and the only difference is how hard it is to drain/filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cold brew large batches to keg with nitro and also drink it straight and here are a few notes I have about my two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Time:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time range everyone says is 12h-24h. I think this is about right and I think the sweet spot for normal brews is about 16h at room temperature. Closer to 24 hours can often taste &quot;over extracted&quot; and will be more bitter, but also more caffeinated. If you're trying to brew stronger, I'd try keeping your ratio the same and adjusting time to see what you want the brew to taste like first. Higher ratio brews seem to also benefit from longer steep times as solubility can become a factor, so usually if I like a coffee at 0.125 ratio for 14 hours and I go to make a 0.200 ratio brew, I'll steep it for 15-16 hours instead to make sure I can dilute it down to how I like it. This is where things tend to be by &quot;feel&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Ratio&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ratio is much more scientific. It's just how much water and how much ground coffee you use. Protip: Use metric units and measure your ratio as Kg coffee : L water. This makes life way easier since you don't buy water by weight, but 1 Kg of water = 1 L of water, so your ratio makes sense. Here are the ratios I regularly use:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.100&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;Beginner&quot; Nitro cold brew. If you want to serve a keg of cold brew and nitrogenate it, but your audience is family or non-coffee enthusiasts, this is a good ratio so that people don't chug a cup of it and feel like their eyes are going to pop out from the caffeine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.110&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;The book&quot; cold brew: loads of people swear by &quot;1 gallon of water per 1lb of coffee&quot; ratio. That's 0.110. I rarely use it, but here it is for reference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.166&lt;/strong&gt;: Flat, everyday cold brew, fresh. I frequently make fresh cold brew overnight for myself. When I wake up it's room temperature and when it drips through a filter, it has a pleasant CO2 frothiness to it. I drink this over ice, which dilutes it close to 0.125 and if there are leftovers, I'll store them in the fridge and drink them straight later. It's a good ratio if you're not planning anything and want it to be flexible.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.185&lt;/strong&gt;: Strong. When I make nitro for enthusiasts, I brew here. This is a really rich, strong flavor. The creaminess of the nitrogen makes up for the fact that it's not diluted. Make no mistake, this is very strong to drink straight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.200&lt;/strong&gt;: Concentrate for 1:1 dilution. I don't typically do water dilution. I rarely brew here, but this concentrate could work with a mix of ice and condensed milk or just cold cream.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.250&lt;/strong&gt;: Strong concentrate for 1:1 or higher dilution. If I make concentrate, I make it at this ratio for 16h+. Again, I don't do water dilutions, but over ice and cream or condensed milk, this can really make a good coffee flavored beverage or save space for storage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I like Ethiopian beans for flat cold brew. I've tried several beans for Nitro and not had one I didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Doing this tells me/us what we need to do while roasting to highlight/change the flavor profile of the roast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The high acidity/brightness of a light roasted Kenya disappears as the cup cools. The darker roasted coffee that will show more &quot;sweetness&quot; at a high temp will show off more as it cools. These are but two examples.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think it is generally regarded that beans are still 'fresh' within one month of roasting where the flavour profile of the bean will change over that one month. Dissecting it further, people tend to agree that beans should be at their peak within 2 weeks of roasting. Past a month the bean should show noticeable signs of decline in the flavour profile, losing most of the brighter notes and acidity and providing a much flatter flavour profile as most complex compounds in the coffee would have disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention that your friend has had those beans for over 4 months, even if measured since the roast date, you can safely say that those beans are stale. At this point there's really no difference between getting rid of them now or later as they should not degrade much further if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The digestive problems you've experienced may be due to the acidity of the coffee. Now lighter roasted coffee will definitely be more acidic so the roast level of the bean can be at play. Not only that, but underextraction can cause high levels of acidity also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only discernible difference I can garner from what you've told me is that in the Aeropress there is a slight form of full immersion brewing. This will better encourage all parts of the coffee to be well extracted and so reduce the acidity of the resulting cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're curious as to what the real cause is, buy two different batches of beans, one medium-dark roast and one light roast. Then perform Aeropress, French press, pourover, espresso and possibly drip extractions with both beans and note down your gastric reaction to each cup. If there is almost no significant difference between any of them to how it makes you feel i.e. it seems to occur at random, you might just be hyper-sensitive to small changes in acidity caused by the differences in the imperfections of each extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Without any more specific information about the coffee you use and what recipe you use for the french press, we won't be able to give you a specific answer with a solution to your problem. However too acidic probably means that your coffee is underextracted. That means the water hasn't had enough time or wasn't hot enough to extract the flavor compounds you want out of the ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few variables that will influence extraction with french press. I already mentioned time and heat. A recipe that I have used with very good results is 6g coffee per 100ml of water, ground to the size of coarse salt with a steep time of 4min. At first you only add a little water (just off the boil), twice to three times the weight of coffee grounds and let sit for 1min. Then give it a stir (there will be grounds on the top forming a crust), add the rest of the water and wait until 4min. Plunge and immediately transfer your coffee to a preheated vessel, either your mugs or a jug. Important here is that you don't let the coffee sit as it will continue to extract and taste bitter after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should give you an even, full bodied extraction. If you feel like it's still too acidic, you could vary the variables involved. If you grind slightly finer the extraction will be higher. Same thing if you increase the brew time a bit. I suggest you just play around and keep in mind that these variables are not independent of each other. Finer grind means faster extraction for example. With a basic understanding of how extraction works you should get the hang of it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the coffee still tastes too acidic although you have tried all suggestions check if the roast is too light, since light roasts tend to have more acidity. Also the origin of your coffee is a factor, african coffees (there are many different regions and processing methods so this is a big generalization) tend to be more acidic, while sumatran coffees are considered the least acidic. Central and South American coffees will often have acidity levels in the middle range.&#xA;It might also be sour because the coffee is stale (around 4 weeks after roasting for whole beans, much much much faster for preground) or it might just be shitty coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a good little intro in the world of extraction (or rather which tastes are associated with different levels of extraction):&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/blog/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Extraction and How to Taste It&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a very nice little graphic with explanations that helps identifying which extraction problem you have and how to solve it:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Coffee Compass.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers and enjoy a nice cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I mainly used Toddy and other full immersion techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the place I work we just use the Toddy. For big batches it is in my opinion the best alternative. We have a drip stand (Hario or some other fancy wooden thing) as well, but it's just not as good, because the water is dripping on the same spot of coffee grounds constantly. You can mitigate that by placing a round paper filter on the grounds (from Aeropress e.g.), however there will still be some uneven extraction. An alternative is the Filtron system, which is basically the same thing. What you could do as well is just brew it in big jars or barrels and then filter it in 3 levels with a restrainer, cheese cloth and coffee filters.&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/blog/cold-brewer-roundup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here is&lt;/a&gt; a nice little comparison by Stumptown coffee, that places the Filtron and Toddy system on the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, cold brew works best with washed Ethiopian/Kenian light roasted coffees in my opinion, which really brings out a lot of sweetness and a nice floral flavor. Cold brew generally reduces acidity, so it works well with high acidity (african) coffees. Sumatran coffees, which would match your flavor requests, are already very low in acidity so the cold brew method can't really shine here. You can also try natural processed african coffees, they would be more full bodied, chocolaty and with notes of red berries (had an amazing ethiopian natural that tasted incredibly like strawberries). They are not really my thing though, a bit flavor overkill most of the times.&#xA;Central American coffees usually work quite well as well, with a bit more nutty, caramel and chocolaty flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've written something on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3064/what-are-good-methods-to-prepare-and-vend-cold-brew/3185#3185&quot;&gt;in this question&lt;/a&gt; already. In any case I use very high coffee to water ratios and don't dilute the concentrate (just served on a lot if ice). However for many people that is too strong and they dilute it with water or even add a little milk, which works quite well with this kind of concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depends on your taste and the best recommendation anyone can give you here is to try a lot of different coffees and recipes until you find your style. You should definitely do some testing before you sell, so you actually like what you are selling and understand what it is. Generally longer contact time means higher extraction, 12 to 14 hours is what I do at home (in a mason jar) and I like it most. In the shop we do faster brews though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well I hope that helped, I'm happy about comments and suggestions how to improve the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;First things first, the ingredients of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;crema&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is partly the answer of this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The foam on top of any coffee beverage (espresso, Turkish, aeropress or any other) is formed simply the same. A lipid/water emulsion forms the outer sphere and some gas is inside this sphere. All these spheres stick to each other with tiny coffee bean fragments invisible to human eye. Let's focus to the gas. The gas is mostly Carbon dioxide that is produced during the Maillard reaction when the coffee beans are roasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we know the chemistry behind. There are three (actually four, but water is there all the time) main contents for our recipe to produce crema:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lipids&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coffee bean fragments&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Carbon dioxide&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lipids and Carbon dioxide are formed by roasting. Fragments are the very very fine powders emerge as the side product of grinding. Fragments don't leave the ground coffee. Lipids, too. But, Carbon dioxide flies away in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, after roasting the beans, it is better to wait for two to four days (based on many criteria just like bean type, roast level, brewing technique, etc.) for the Carbon dioxide level of the roasted beans to settle. Then, the flavor of those beans will be delicious. After that time, Carbon dioxide fades away and the roasted beans start to stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can reason, if your beans have less Carbon dioxide, your final cup of coffee would have less crema. If you have freshly roasted (e.g. 3-days old) coffee, your final cup of espresso would have a thick foam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also known that water pressure affects the crema volume, but should not affect as much as you mentioned here. Even at 7 bars, a decent crema forms according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12452670&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a note, if your machine has difficulties producing enough pressure, more tamping will probably results over-heated water flowing very slowly through the grounds, causing them to burn and all of the lipids to evaporate, could not form the spheres of the crema. As a result, you probably worsen the crema production, coffee odor fills the room but you cannot drink that flavor. Now, all you'll get is boiled coffee juice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of crema is mostly correlated with the freshness of the coffee, not the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It seems to be vaguely salty + a lot of something else very destinctive that I can not describe.

Usually there is a noticeable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the flavor will not improve with more rest. That means that I did not roast the bean far enough.

I've seen lipids floating on coffee many times before, but as far as I can remember, they just formed boring puddles or were entirely absent (maybe due to using a thicker filter). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I welcome any attempt, preferably backed by published research, to explain this distracting phenomenon as well as pictures of similar curves formed by lipids on liquid surfaces (preferably coffee).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's probably not a dragon curve, but the fractal projection of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brownian motion&lt;/a&gt; of coffee lipids on the surface of your tasty beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brownian motion is best explained by statistical physics. Small atoms or molecules collide each other continuously in very high speeds in the liquids even if they seem serene. However, as the total effect (average) of these collisions are quite stable, we see a still surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The small particles, which are very light in mass, can be affected by these collisions. So, they may move with respect to these collisions. So, you can observe these collisions as &lt;strong&gt;Brownian motions&lt;/strong&gt; if you put some very light powder or lipid on top of the surface of a liquid. Very probably, this is what you have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can find a very comprehensive list of fractal sketches, including the ones related to Brownian motion.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You will just have to find some form of compromise. I think the best way would be to empty the Hopper and then fill it with the new beans (also sometimes you might want to switch up the espresso?). You should figure out how your grinder behaves once it's getting more empty and with this knowledge you can quite easily adjust the extraction such that the quality will not decrease too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most likely case is that the dose will decrease slightly. You could put a scale next to the hopper and if you feel like your espresso is running faster, check if the dose changed because the hopper is getting empty and adjust your grinder accordingly. I think checking the dose and grind occasionally throughout the day is a good way to up your espresso game in any case. It helps me learn a lot about the coffee and setup. There's tons of variables, like humidity and temperature that will change the behavior of the grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The dosing I used was generally recommended for a single shot of espresso, but I used the 2-cup pressurised filter instead of the other smaller one that's said to be for PODs. &lt;strong&gt;Question 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Any recommendations for getting a better shot of espresso from these things that I already have?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also would like to try the non-pressurised filter selling online as it's claimed to produce better quality espresso. I have learned that this kind of filter is commercially used with commercial machines that generate the brewing pressure at 9 bars. But my Gaggia classic is 15 bars, based on the specification document. &lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Will this higher pressure result in faster extraction when I use a non-pressurised filter? I have learned that there are other factors that help slow down the extraction time such as tamping and grinding size, but &lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Will these factors be significant enough to overcome the 15 bars?

How I came up with the adjustment was because at the time I had my home grinder configured for french press and was using it daily, and I simply did a comparison of grind levels until the adjustment appeared to be the same size.  Given a normalized 11 setting, everything else should match up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first purchased my EK43, I felt that it did not allow coarse enough grinding to get to French press level grinds.  I pulled the tap screws on the grind adjustment knob and and loosened the burrs equivalent of 2 grind units (effectively making grind level 3 originally a 1).  This adjusted the grinder such that an 11 was a French press grind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once this is configured, and presuming you are using the 'new' EK43 burrs, I use the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;11 - French Press and cupping samples&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7.5-8 - Drip brew and Keurig depending on desired strength.  This setting will also work with Bunn brewers IF the user uses the proper amount of grounds, which almost no one does.. For 110oz airpots we were using 175g grounds at a 7.5.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4.5 - For those stubborn people who use half as many grounds as they are supposed to on Bunn brewers..  I've got a few companies like this, and have to grind fine, otherwise the coffee comes out underextracted.  I wish I could just tell them to double the amount of coffee they put in the machine but.. oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This setup is basically useless for espresso grinding.  It works halfway decent if you are using a pressurized portafilter (like an EC155 or something) If someone asked for an espresso level grind on this setup, I would give them a 1 and it would be quite fine, but probably wouldn't be clumping at all. No one discerning enough to know the differences in espresso grinds is going to ask for it pre-ground anyways so I just ignore this bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these settings are with basically brand new burrs.. of course as they wear, I will have to adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The math is fairly simple. You know for how much concentrated cold brew you will be using that it is at a ratio of 1:4. Since the resulting concentration of the cold brew is constant (since it has already been brewed) we only really care about the parts of water that are in it; 4 parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore to calculate how much water you need to add to dilute your 1:4 concentrate into a 1:15 cup, divide the amount of concentrate you are using by 4 and then multiply that by the remaining parts you wish to add, which is &lt;code&gt;15 - 4 = 11&lt;/code&gt; which gives you the amount of water you need to add in whatever units you measured the amount of concentrate you started with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using your example numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Start with 100g of cold brew concentrate at 1:4 ratio. Each part of water is therefore &lt;code&gt;100/4 = 25g&lt;/code&gt;. The amount of water you will need to add is therefore &lt;code&gt;11 x 25g = 275g&lt;/code&gt; to result in a total amount of 375g in your final cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check the final answer by doing a reverse calculation. If the concentrate is 1:4 and you have 100g of it, it means you started with 25g of ground coffee. Therefore making a 1:15 ratio cup of coffee with 25g of coffee means &lt;code&gt;25g x 15 = 375g&lt;/code&gt; of water must be added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers align.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an amount of cold brew to be diluted, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;units&lt;/em&gt;, which has a coffee-to-water ratio of &lt;code&gt;1:n&lt;/code&gt;, the amount of each part of water in the cold brew, &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;c/n&lt;/code&gt;. The amount of water to be added to achieve a final ratio of &lt;code&gt;1:m&lt;/code&gt; is therefore &lt;code&gt;w x (m-n)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;units&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Units&lt;/em&gt; are any form of measure of the liquid mass being used, in g, mL or others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This question is fairly ambiguous as you've simply described the result as a 'desired taste' so I cannot tackle the question from a specific angle. However, the differences you describe may be a symptom of the fact that there are big differences between instant coffee and your pour-over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual coffee.&lt;/strong&gt; Your pour-over must be done with coffee grounds and so you are producing a cup of coffee freshly extracted from the grounds and subsequently freshly enjoyed. Not to mention the beans used might simply be of a higher quality than that used in instant coffee manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pour-over.&lt;/strong&gt; The brewing method itself is often known to produce much more nuanced flavours as it allows the brewer control of water flow as opposed to automated brewers. This means that you can better extract the sugars and compounds that give coffee its aroma and flavour. Instant coffee is not fresh and the general manufacturing process is done en masse so the level of control that you would have to fine tune your cup of pour-over coffee will simply not be present in instant coffee. Also, due to the extra processes involved in freeze-drying and packaging the instant coffee, many flavourful compounds can be lost well before it reaches your cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The factors noted above can change the resulting cup you enjoy and therefore change the amount of milk or sugar you will need in order for you to achieve your desired taste. Since the pour-over method can extract more sugars and delicate compounds that make coffee so delicious, it will also reduce the requirement of extra sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

So it is impossible really to draw any specific conclusions without knowing how hot the water is and how long the extraction takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However there are some general rules that always apply as the aforementioned slower extraction at lower temperatures. Another one is that with increasing contact time the extraction will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavor lower extractions are generally associated with more acidic/sour coffee and the higher the extraction the more of the bitter compounds will be in your cup. An ideal extraction will be balanced with some fruity acidity and some darker, chocolaty flavors. Since you are using a full immersion technique it will not make that much of a difference though. I imagine you wait a few minutes before you start drinking the coffee? So there's probably a short moment where the extraction is balanced but the longer you sip on your cup the more bitter it gets which means overextraction. I think time is the more relevant variable in your case (if my estimate of the temperature is more or less correct)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health wise I don't think it will make much of a difference either for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the caffein is extracted early on and by the end the extraction will be relatively high, regardless of the somewhat lower initial temperature. And since you are doing full immersion you will additionally always ingest a good amount of coffee grounds anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;We bought a pack of coffee and had it ground on site, like many times before. The new sales girl must have misunderstood something and used a too-fine setting, finest (for espresso) instead of second finest (for my moka).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now if I use it, I get many grounds in the top container and basically have to discard about a quarter of the brew each time as its just a grainy sludge at the bottom.

It is something I would try but would not recommend to anyone else. I have seen moka pots that weren't closed properly and almost exploded or that lacked the mesh filter inside and just kind of clocked up and then erupted a big fountain of hot coffee like a volcano. It's not pretty and rather dangerous. However I would put an aeropress like round paper filter (or any other thin paper/cloth filter cut into the right shape) inside on your coffee grounds or under the mesh filter. That would keep out the fines, but might lead to said increase of pressure (a Bialetti stove top has a pressure valve for security reasons, I've never seen it do it's job though). There's no guaranty that this would work or that no one gets hurt though, so I'm not suggesting you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My question is actually in reference to a JavaScript book by Reg Braithwaite titled &quot;JavaScript Allongé&quot;. Obviously JavaScript has almost nothing to do with coffee, but the author maintained a coffee barista metaphor throughout the book and stated that allongé is some coffee variant. So for the uninitiated coffee drinkers out there among his readers, can you explain what an allongé is, what makes it unique, and how to actually pronounce it? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author does offer a brief description quoted from &lt;em&gt;Caffe Molinari&lt;/em&gt; linked &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-a-pull-of-the-lever-prefaces&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but as a coffee newbie much of what is being described escapes me. Here is the quoted text from Braithwaite's preface:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Café Allongé, also called Espresso Lungo, is a drink midway between&#xA;  an Espresso and Americano in strength. There are two different ways to&#xA;  make it. The first, and the one I prefer, is to add a small amount of&#xA;  hot water to a double or quadruple Espresso Ristretto. Like adding a&#xA;  splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of the&#xA;  complex flavours in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The second way is to pull an extra long double shot of Espresso. This&#xA;  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution&#xA;  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the&#xA;  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and&#xA;  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it&#xA;  releases even more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use&#xA;  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.&#xA;  Moderation in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The Kalita and Chemex equipment are designed for pour-over brewing. If you are using them as vessel-recipients of water from an automated dripper, it will not produce the kind of cup you desire due to the randomness at which it applies water over the bed of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing pour-over, there are a few major parameters that you will have to control to produce clean cups. Note that you will require a gooseneck kettle in order to have proper control over the water flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind. Ensure that you are using a burr grinder that is of decent quality, meaning that it can grind to a good consistency with a low number of fines. Fines are smaller granules of coffee produced in the grinding process as the beans are crushed and can over-extract to bring out bitter flavours. Your grind size should also be of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kuissential.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04-Intro2B.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water Temperature. This is one of the most important factors of the bunch for pour-over brewing in my experience. It's the parameter that you will change to fine tune how many compounds are being dissolved as you brew once you have a grind size that is in the right ball park. You should experiment with this as it will depend on the grind size and dose you use but I like to keep it at around 90 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Agitation. This measures how much you move and disturb the coffee. The more you agitate it by pouring, the more you continuously expose the coffee grounds to the water and encourage extraction. Controlling this will be another experimental variable for your specific parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the above three that I believe to be the most important factors in what makes a clean pour-over brew, you should also take into account, the brew time, coffee-to-water ratio, coffee dose and obviously coffee origin and freshness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Try using a high heat to get the coffee flowing, then adjust the heat to keep an even flow into the top chamber. It's possible that with a bad seal, extra pressure was being release from the screw joint and now it is all being directed through the &quot;tower&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe try just keeping it cranked on heat for the whole brew, then low for the whole brew, then mix in between.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have no specific experience with this cold brew device but a general understanding of how extraction works and experience with other devices. In short, you can definitely use water at room temperature to make cold brew (I think it is better), but there seem to be some specific issues with this cold brew maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general the colder the water, the slower it will extract the solid compounds from the coffee. This is the main thing you have to keep in mind, because you will have to adjust some other variables in order to reach the right extraction. In their instructions they suggest you use a medium grind level. This is one variable you could change. Instead of a medium grind level I would use a medium to coarse grind. Another variable that you could change is the brew time. They set the device to 1 drop per second but you could increase that a little to speed up the brewing process, resulting in less extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically with this device there seems to be the problem, that air bubbles block the valve (see the FAQ on the website). They argue that the changing water temperature is responsible for the bubbles to appear. However if you brew at room temperature the water temperature should be much more consistent than with ice water which will obviously melt eventually and then the water will warm up. So I'm not quite sure about their logic (unless you are supposed to add ice until the brewing is over).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you go ahead and try it at room temperature, adjusting the other variables. Make sure you pre infuse properly so the grounds degas as much as possible, that should prevent too much gas blocking the valve. Alternatively you could use refrigerated water and brew it in the fridge.&#xA;Hope this helps, in the end it's a lot of trial and error anyways. Have fun brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Amount of coffee in French press vs. K-Cups"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Last night I was at a restaurant with friends and we were discussing coffee. So I shared that I typically use a French press with around 25g for a &quot;real&quot; cup (~400 mL). Everyone was suprised at how much coffee that is. Yet pretty much every website I've seen about French press recommends something around these lines, or more. Also - and more importantly - I've tried lowering the amount and it does taste thin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;YET... I do enjoy for instance K-cup coffee, which is around 10g/cup. Does it mean the French press is not economical at all? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Consider trying an AeroPress coffee maker. It's kind of a redesigned French Press. It's quick, makes smooth coffee, and is easy to clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you put in one heaping (rounded) scoop of coffee, that's 14 grams or 3 tablespoons, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While you're on the FAQ page, it answers interesting questions like about gentler coffee:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;... about one-fifth the acidity of drip brewed coffee and one-ninth the acidity of French press brewed coffee. Because of this it’s easier on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have a web page &lt;a href=&quot;http://aerobie.com/aeropress/aeropress-vs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;comparing AeroPress&lt;/a&gt; with French Press and other kinds of coffee makers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;French presses use coarsely ground coffee because of the size of the holes in their filters. The coarsely ground coffee particles have less surface area than finely ground coffee. The lower surface area necessitates a long steeping time to extract full coffee flavor. Unfortunately, this results in bitterness and acidity in the cup. The AeroPress uses espresso or fine-drip grind coffee with a big surface area to quickly extract rich, full flavor without bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The coarsely ground coffee required by French press filters unfortunately includes some small particles which pass through the filter and into your cup. These particles continue to leach bitterness leading to a harsh, gritty brew. AeroPress brewed coffee is micro filtered so it is pure and particle free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;French presses cannot produce espresso style coffee and therefore the drinks that can be made with it. The AeroPress can produce regular American style coffee or an espresso style concentrate which can be used like espresso in espresso based drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All ground coffee contains the molecules cafestol and kahweol, two molecules which raise LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. The metal filters in French presses do not filter out cafestol and kahweol. The AeroPress’s paper filters do remove them, meaning that AeroPress brewed coffee is free of these harmful elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;French presses are notoriously difficult to clean. The AeroPress is essentially self cleaning, requiring only a quick rinse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you use a Baratza grinder, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baratza.com/grinding-tips/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for their recommended grind sizes. (The page also has a link to different brewing recipes, but to be honest, I'm happy with the standard recipe.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I own this machine and have since moved on from it for the exact reasons you stated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to create microfoam that is good enough for making clearly defined latte art on the Delonghi Dedica but it requires practice (as would doing the same on any machine). You did the right thing by removing the metal sleeve but the main problem is that the steam power is relatively weak and so it makes it harder to create the vortex required to properly incorporate the aerated milk. Focus on trying to create a spinning vortex/whirlpool type effect in your milk as this is the most important step in ensuring you end up with silky milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aerate the milk by keeping the tip of the steam wand near the surface of the milk. You should hear spitting noises. This will introduce air into the milk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you have aerated enough, dip the tip of the steam wand below the surface and try to form a vortex/whirlpool.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spin the milk as in step 2 until the milk is at the right temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For good latte milk, you should not over-aerate. A good starting point is simply raising the height of the milk in your pitcher by about a centimetre. Once again, however, it will require practice and even then it may not be perfect due to the lack of steaming power this machine has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Delonghi Dedica also uses a pressurised portafilter basket which means that the crema you find in your cup is a result of artificial pressures produced inside the basket (similar to how Nespresso machines make their 'crema'). You can attempt to create darker crema by making the pressurised basket not the limiting factor of extraction by grinding finer (but not so fine as to choke the machine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature-wise, you want to ensure that your portafilter is heated by running empty shots through it as it will cool down the shot as it moves through the portafilter. The steam is also not as hot as commercial machines as they have dedicated boilers for the steaming rather than interchanging between functions within a few seconds like the Delonghi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, if you enjoy your coffee the way you make it, stick with the Delonghi Dedica but if you put a lot of value in the quality of the crema and being able to pour latte art then you might want to consider an upgrade or investing more time into practicing milk steaming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

So here's another: The mechanism itself could be clogged with gunk, and after detecting too much load or force, the control software backs off for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A test for both of these hypotheses is to open the machine and clean the works. The difference between the two hypotheses is whether it's the sensor or the mechanism that needs cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The service manual would help with hypothesis generation and testing. What start up checks does it do? What &amp;amp; where are the sensors? What parts need to work properly for the grinder engagement mechanism to work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis: The mechanism needs lubrication. The service manual should indicate what to lubricate, what not to lubricate, and what lube to use. Or you could guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis is a rubber O-ring has worn out or broken. This is also consistent with what you've written, i.e. your existing experience can rule out some hypotheses. It can also make other hypotheses less likely, e.g. if the cause is the same as last time (not a sure bet), a burned out motor would've cost you for parts, while a worn out O-ring might not have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also: There are local and online repair clinics to help with appliance repair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth trying.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you can remove the coffee grounds/filter and replace just those, then yes it will be safe from a health perspective.  The plastic in the filter &quot;cone&quot; should be food safe, though durability may be an eventual concern.  The plastic cup base can definitely be reused, as is intended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as the practicality concerns go, it may be more of a pain than it's worth.  The coffee containing part of the filter funnel is going to be pretty well attached, in order to keep it from slipping into the cup below and steeping (like tea) vs. simply having the water run through it.  You could probably remove the coffee filter and perch a coffee pod in it's place, but it would not be sealed to the plastic cone, and hot water may run around it without actually percolating through the coffee grounds in the pod.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Any decent barista from the (self proclaimed) high-end places you mention should be familiar with these terms anyway.

The water is not very close to boiling temperatures. You wait for a while to brew it. At the end, the output is coffee with some fine residue of coffee ground in it. This may continue to brew while you drink. So, it must be consumed fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual pour-over&lt;/strong&gt;: Coffee and water are in two different compartments.

The characteristic and appealing aroma of brewing coffee comes from Arabica beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And Robusta which has more caffeine and is traditionally valued in Italy for it's ability to increase crema. It's also sometimes used to increase the caffeine in an espresso blend. Robusta is generally considered to have an inferior flavour profile to Arabica and usually commands lower prices and is largely relegated to use in lower quality, mass market instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robusta is a heirloom bean that was on the verge of extinction only thirty years ago and remains unknown to much of the world. It has a completely different flavour profile.

Hotter water (92-100 degrees celsius) always gives me more bitterness and earthy flavors.  I use an electric kettle with a thermometer to maintain the temperature accurately so I can keep a temperature in the middle, in order to get both sets of flavors.  I would guess that by 2:45, your water is too cool and you're just extracting the acidic notes.  Try keeping your water hotter (and measure to see what temperature you're using).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might also suggest giving your coffee a nice 60 second bloom time (pour enough water over them to get them wet, then wait for the gas to escape).  That helps you extract everything (complex and bitter notes included) from the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could also consider letting your coffee age a bit longer.

Polishing is possible with acids or metal polishes, but will probably not provide more than temporary, cosmetic benefit. That is my experience when trying to &quot;restore&quot; accidentally-dishwashered aluminum: I washed it thoroughly, and I continue to use it in its tarnished state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find a really good reference about these recommendations; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chowhound.com/post/aluminum-dishwasher-rematch-919613&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here's a discussion on Chowhound&lt;/a&gt; with some reasonable information; many more by searching &quot;dishwasher aluminum&quot; or similar.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently started to brew my own coffee using the pour-over method because buying from the coffee shop was getting too expensive for a daily coffee drinker. I bought a bag of coffee grounds and a coffee dripper online. The dripper is a stainless steel type with a couple fine mesh filters in it, which lets me do pour overs without a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's my method: I'm putting 3 tablespoons of grounds into my dripper, and then with a kettle of 17oz, just off the boiling water, begin pouring over my grounds with enough water to fill the dripper half full. I wait 10 seconds while the grounds bloom and then I fill the dripper to the top and wait for the coffee to brew. Then, when the dripper gets about half empty, I fill it back up with water. I intend to end with ~16oz of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My problem is that the grounds end up plugging up my dripper and the drip process ends up taking forever. By the time all the water has passed through my coffee grounds and dripper the coffee is COLD!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? Am I trying to get too much coffee out of the pour-over method? Is it really only meant for a single cup serving? Like 6oz and 1 tablespoon of grounds? Are my grounds not fine enough?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Despite what everyone is saying here, I've done a little research and I've read that when doing pour overs, you want your grind to be more fine. They say the consistency of sugar, not sea salt. I find a little truth to this in that when I originally bought the dripper, I used a bag that had grounds that have been much more fine that what I've been using lately. Needless to say, I think I just need to experiment with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtHWN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtHWN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coffee dripper&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that the dripper itself may have a design flaw (does it work for small servings?):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Surely enough, the diameter of the dripper's lower throughput sieve&lt;br&gt;&#xA; a) influences maximum dripping speed&lt;br&gt;&#xA; b) determines how much pressure will build up, given mass of coffee grounds and of water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while designing a dripper properly, a target serving size has to be assumed and I'm assuming it wouldn't have been your 16oz, rather max. half of it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You could probably make the grounds &lt;em&gt;coarser&lt;/em&gt; to prevent clogging (e.g., pebbles wouldn't clog your filter's water passage way, sand would), but when you go too coarse, the throughout may become too fast and you'll get thin coffee without proper substance/taste. So you'll have to find​ d your optimal configuration.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;How you pour water has an effect, as well. Pouring too quickly may lead to pressure that contributes to clogging. Don't pour all the water at once, have a slow steady stream that you distribute over the uoper surface of the grounds. Keep the falling distance for the water/the distance between your hot water output and.the coffee grounds' surface minimal (=less velocity -&gt; less pressure).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, pour hot water into the container your dripper is supposed to drip into prior to brewing, let it warm up (it doesn't have to be all filled up, you can sway it/close and rotate it to distribute the heat - don't waste too much energy), then empty just prior to dripping. How long you should optimally warm up depends on your container material, of course - a thick mug warmed up long enough will retain heat for a long, good time :) Thin porcelain doesn't need long warming, obviously.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You can also warm up the cup by microwaving it with a little water inside (be careful not to have the water evaporate/ overheat the cup), but I've found microwaves often don't heat up uniformly...  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.s.: When getting rid of the warm water, you can first pour it through your empty coffee dripper, so &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is also warmed up (no need for extra water on that, it's thin metal with little heat resistance, anyways, so pouring through warm water will most likely do the trick)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The brewing chambers were simplistic, but the biggest downside was lack of accurate temperature control.  Water needs to ideally be right at 205 F plus or minus a few degrees depending on coffee type, roast and age.  Newer drip brewers rely on updated electronics that can accurately keep the water temperature in this narrow range which is going to give you improved coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the shower head at the top of the brew chamber.  Does it pour the water down in a single stream, or does it distribute the water nicely across the grounds?  This makes a difference in brew quality and on newer machines, more thought has gone into this design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pump rate -- if you read up on how people do pour over, a lot of focus is on timing.  Allowing the coffee to bloom, then proper water per minute rates must be adhered to.  All of these details will change the flavor of the coffee.  Newer machines again have better control over these variables due to improved electronics which allow them to produce more consistent, and hopefully better coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thermal Carafe -- I just had to throw this in here; these machines brew into an insulated carafe rather than a non-insulated carafe with heater underneath.  In my opinion, thermal carafes are amazing, and they have become much more available now that they once were.  Nothing will kill your coffee faster than a carafe 'warmer' (I mean cooker...) under a non-insulated carafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned Keurig.  Keurig is a whole different animal unfortunately.  They have managed to corner the market on a particular brewing style (which by the way is inferior to old fashioned methods), albeit more convenient.  You get the perks of the newer machines mentioned above in a $300 Keurig machine, but I don't believe the grounds chamber is big enough to actually brew a full cup of coffee, and I believe it brews too quickly to get a fully developed cup of coffee.  Read thin and bright coffee compared to pour over, french press, quality drip.  $200 bucks of the $300 goes either to the electronics of allowing you to brew a single cup at a time, validating it is a legit k-cup (they did away with the microchips in K-Cups I think?) or simply name brand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

When you've done that, you should have measurements for how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk you need for one cup of coffee.

I cannot even remember when I first hear some of them.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nescafe Classic is pure Robusta, but this claim is hidden recently. Still, if you Google it with keywords as &quot;%100 percent robusta Nescafe&quot; you may see old web pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nescafe Gold is a blend, ratios are unknown.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More recent Nescafe Dolce Gusto is 30% Arabica, 70% Robusta. So, I doubt the Arabica ratio of Gold is less than 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Does longer brewing time with hot water negatively effect flavor?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been reading the answers to related questions, but I'm still confused about the variable of the length of brewing time. I've heard that when using a Moka pot, one should turn off the flame immediately upon hearing the very first gurgle sound because if it brews a little bit longer (before the pot starts spurting coffee) the resulting liquid coffee can taste more bitter. I've also read that one of the benefits of the Aeropress is that the &quot;brewing&quot; time is so minimal that the coffee tastes better and is &quot;cleaner&quot;. If less brewing time=less bitter,then does coffee made with a french press inherently taste more bitter than other methods? (Maybe people that use the french press prefer more bitterness?) I also read a post elsewhere from a person who says she bought a single-cup coffee filter holder with three holes at the bottom rather than the typical one hole, and that the coffee tasted better because the water drained more quickly. Does the faster the coffee passes through a filter make it less bitter? If so, I wonder why the three hole filter holder isn't more sold more frequently. The art of coffee brewing can be so mysterious ;/&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As discussed further in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/14/what-is-the-process-to-reduce-bitterness-in-coffee&quot;&gt;this question about bitterness&lt;/a&gt;, degree of extraction is one significant factor in bitterness in your cup. There are a couple of other links to coffee bitterness in that question also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping other major factors constant (e.g., same temperature of water, same beans), &lt;em&gt;time and grind level&lt;/em&gt; are the easiest to modify to reduce bitterness. That is: &lt;strong&gt;shorter time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coarser grind&lt;/strong&gt; will (generally) result in less bitter coffee. While you certainly can't expect to get a reasonable brew from barely chopped beans in 15 seconds, small changes in time and grind level can have a noticeable impact on outcomes, especially for immersion-style brewing methods like French press, Aeropress, pour-over, and to a lesser extent stovetop methods like percolator or moka.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifics vary by brewing method. For instance, some bitter-tasting compounds are filtered out by paper filters, so paper-filter pour-over will generally be less bitter than French press, for example. Also, your average paper filter will allow brewed coffee to filter more quickly with a coarser grind (finer grinds will more quickly clog the filter) so you might have to vary your pouring method to keep the total brewing time constant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy trying to vary one parameter at a time: trying coarser- or finer-grind coffee, then with a shorter or longer period of time, in both cases trying to vary only one parameter at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This is discussed in many different contexts many times, I assume. So, I can say not a very strange question in essence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I advise you to check a previous answer first. It includes a very nice chart and the ideal point for quality brewing of coffee. Also, it shows the extraction ratios, a hint of TDS (total dissolved solids) etc. I copy its link just below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/481/whats-the-recommended-coffee-to-water-ratio-for-cold-brew/3440#3440&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s the recommended coffee to water ratio for cold brew?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you see, if you can manage to brew an ideal coffee, you can extract only around 20% of the valuable &quot;essence&quot; from the core of the beans. That's the reason why some of the members of &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Coffee SE&lt;/a&gt; tries to re-brew the used grounds for a second time (I assume), as you can follow below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1749/brewing-with-the-coffee-grounds-twice&quot;&gt;Brewing with the coffee grounds twice?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, some other members discuss the TDS part to find the golden brewing point at the first chart. The easiest way to follow that point repeatedly is done by a refractometer. It is a device that can measure opaqueness. So, by measuring the opaqueness of your brew, you may reason on the amount of dissolved coffee &quot;essence&quot; in the water; therefore you may estimate the strength of your cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3444/options-for-measuring-tds-suggested-refractometers&quot;&gt;Options for measuring TDS - Suggested refractometers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2156/are-there-any-alternatives-to-using-a-refractometer-to-determine-extraction&quot;&gt;Are there any Alternatives to using a Refractometer to determine extraction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope these previous answers and the path I've directed you helps you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="What is going wrong with this Espresso shot?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I am a coffee roaster and am working through building a standard espresso profile for coffee shops in my area.  I'm working with a particular shop that is interested in my coffee, but for some reason the espresso pulls extremely sour on their machine.  I'm looking for ideas as to what might be going on.  I've done quite a bit of research, so I'll add in what I have done thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Setup (Shots pull good)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;18g grounds, pulling 2 fl oz with a final weight around 50g&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Machine is a Rocket Apartamento, nearly brand new.  Water is filtered, non RO, boiler pressure is at 1.2-1.3 bar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grinder is a Breville Dose Control Pro, also new.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shots are pulling in about 26-28 seconds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso has good crema that stands up for longer than 1 minute and has rich orange / red tones.  Shot is lively, but not sour with no hint of bitterness, and good heavy body.  This isn't a fruit bomb blend or anything, I am more looking for something that a typical coffee shop customer would find palatable.  Espresso stands up to milk very well.  Personally, I almost feel like the roast may be slightly too dark since with milk, I start getting a hint of roasty-ness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop Setup (Sour Shots)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;18g grounds, pulling 36g output (supposedly this is 2 fl oz also, can't verify as I haven't seen markings on the glass they are pulling into.  If anything, I would say it is probably a 2.5-3oz pull)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Machine is A Nuevo Simonelli Aurelia 2.  Boiler pressure 1.4 bar, pump pressure 9.5 to 10 later in the pull. Water is not filtered to my knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grinder is a used Mazzer, unknown burr wear (personally I'm thinking this is a likely culprit?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shots are timed for a 27-30 second pull.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shots pull extremely bright / sour, crema tends to be closer to a dirty brown color.  This shot might blend with milk and be drinkable, but just barely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confusing points for me that may bear some explaination...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer pull (and thus probably a finer grind) results in sour coffee, not bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher boiler pressure = higher water temp which tends to scorch if too high and impart more bitter qualities, yet this is sour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is his 2 fl oz of extract such lower weight than my 2 fl oz.  Crema production is heavy on both machines, but the weight difference almost seems to indicate that the crema on his machine is double or more than what my machine is producing which isn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting espresso via web forum is pretty difficult but I would appreciate any thoughts on how I might go about getting good shots out of this shop machine.  Oh, btw, it wasn't me pulling the shots at the shop, so tamp could definitely be different between the two shots, but given that the pull times are pretty close together, and I did watch the tamp, I can say that technique is at the very minimum similar.  I can say that both tamps appear to at least be even on a naked portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone can really give a definitive answer to this but I'd like to chime in to try to help. It's almost impossible to find your answer because of how many different variables are at play here. You should first focus on minimising the variance in your methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You describe the shop shot as being a 'longer pull' and thereby expecting more bitter results. The problem with that assumption is that you can only truly compare shot times if you have extracted the same output weight in both cases. Since you have not, you have not only extracted much less in your shop shot, but, like you noted, it also took longer. I normally only ever measure my shots by weight because that's the number that tells me how much water got through and thereby how much real contact and subsequent extraction occurred.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I use time as a secondary reference to diagnose other problems in my shot. If I suddenly start extracting a same weight shot in half the time that I normally do, I know something is definitely off. Since your shop shot extracted much less output weight, the sourness is clearly due to some level of underextraction from being stopped too early (relative to your home shot). In any case, I always try to aim for 30g in 30s, which means you probably need to grind slightly finer in the shop to be able to extract more and try to hit the same balance as your home shot.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You mention your water sources being different. This is huge! You will never find the same shot if you are using filtered at home and unfiltered at the shop depending on how hard the water is when unfiltered.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare shot times as a secondary to consistent output weight and see how grinding finer in the shop would fare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher boiler pressure does not necessarily point directly towards higher temperatures. Also, higher pressures could impact the puck suddenly when the valve is opened which could crack and cause channeling and therefore underextraction and sourness. Your main issues here are still in point 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight difference is purely by choice. Crema production is mostly dependent on freshness of beans and less to do with specifics in extraction method. If preset weight quantities are being used as part of a single button-press on a machine, then your problem starts there. You need to weigh every shot and choose when to stop the shot yourself. Without this control, you're simply relinquishing responsibility of the shot and you are at the mercy of the machine, yet another variable to consider in being able to find the right shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you MUST minimise variables. Make sure your grind sizes are the same at both locations, ensure your input and output weight are identical, analyse differences in taste and extraction time at same output weight, ensure your sources of water are identical, make sure your tamp pressures are the same. At this point the only real differences will be the machines and then you can start investigating how each machine is affecting the shots. Try to use bottomless portafilters in order to diagnose whether your distribution of your coffee bed was poor and whether channeling occurs during extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combine all of the parameters above with the taste of your output shots and you'll know the next steps you need to take in finding the problem in your shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Each coffee has it's own special taste and distinctive flavours. Whether it is pre-ground Maxwell House or small-batch roasted single origin, there will be different flavour profiles and smells. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;quality&quot; of coffee is mostly determined by the bitterness and taste. Fresh, great quality coffee is often bright and has complex flavours that fill your palette. Diner coffee is usually bland and more bitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In high-quality beans, the enjoyment of the coffee is then more down to personal taste. That is, whether someone likes a bright, almost tea-like single origin from Ethiopia, or a deep-bodied Sumatran coffee with herbal notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This Kopi Luwak coffee will certainly have it's own distinctive taste, that's for sure. Will it taste better than cheap coffee like Maxwell house? Yes, probably. Will it be the best coffee you've ever had? Maybe not, and that is just fine. People drink this coffee because it is rare and sought after, not neccesarily because they are looking for the best cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for brewing it, I would suggest trying it a number of ways, because each brewing method brings out different flavour profiles. French press will allow you to experience the body that is likely from a South-east asian coffee and will allow the natural oils onto your palette. Pour-over will take away some of that body but accentuate the herbal tones and bring out the top-end in terms of flavours. Espresso is always interesting, and the concentrated method could yield some surprising flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have the means to try it, I would. It's a neat experience and if you are keen on coffee, tasting more coffee, no matter where its from, is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for cleaning your equipment, just make sure to do a regular cleaning of your espresso machine/french press to remove any residue. This doesn't have to be intensive, just make sure there are no leftover grounds. For you grinder, I would disassemble as much as possible and wash and dry the parts. Grinders always retain a decent amount of grounds, and those mixing in with the expensive Kopi Luwat could change the flavour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are three videos where people try this coffee:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dk8_HabWkW0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DpIkE_2Oq3E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Travel Blogger??&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/d_-VoCrpOMU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;News Anchor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The major standards are a bit confusing honestly.  Fair trade provides a baseline above the commodities rates, but they don't ensure that the farmer is getting the most for their product.  Furthermore, the farm has to be able to be certified for conforming to certain environmental conditions prior to being certified.  Many coffee farmers are so far off the beaten path that they simply cannot afford to be certified.  I believe that conscientious importers provide a far better compensation to the farmer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like Fair Trade assures something between 15 and 35 cents above commodities rates.  This is far below what a roaster will pay for specialty grade coffee.  While fair trade is a good baseline, if you purchase specialty coffee, you are most likely buying coffee that was purchased for significantly better than fair trade rates.  To give you an idea.. I pulled up a random invoice I had in my inbox and it was $1.70 above commodities rate.  Furthermore, importers provide on the ground support to farmers in the form of varietal education and recommendations, disease prevention, washing technique improvements, all of which net the farmer tangible benefits because their coffee will improve in quality, and thus, sell for more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So.. if you are looking for good ethical compensation for farmers, I would say look for local specialty roasteries.  These roasteries are purchasing high quality coffee from a high quality importer which means that there are people on the ground helping farmers achieve better quality, and thus better compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The link below is a pretty interesting article from a greens buyer I am thinking about working with.  I found it a very interesting read that gave some insight into what importers actually do, and highlights why a lot of coffee farms are not certified.. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2017/04/40-hours-life-colombian-green-bean-buyer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;40 hours in the life of a greens buyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know this explanation doesn't directly answer your question, but hopefully it sheds some light on the behind the scenes of how coffee buying works.  Fair Trade, Organic, Rainforest Alliance are all great programs, but they can also exclude a lot of hard working farmers, that produce fantastic products, and are very conscientious of the environment etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last bit of food for thought.. My roastery cannot advertise our product as Organic because our kitchen is not certified Organic (I've been officially open only for a few months, after a years worth of building my business and haven't been able to get certification lined up yet).  Despite this, half of my products are certified Organic.  Looking at it from the business perspective, I would love to advertise my product as Organic, but just haven't been able to navigate the red tape, and I am sure there are other small businesses that are in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Aluminium v's Ceramic storage"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been reading a wikipedia article about the best material for a coffee jar for storing beans, which recommends ceramic or dark glass. I then came here and there is a recent question about aluminium packaging for preserving beans. This makes me a little confused, because I thought that aluminium, i.e metal, would affect negatively the taste of the beans. Then I read that ceramic can contain a large amount of lead, which makes me even more concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were thinking about the perfect storage for your beans, what would be your material of choice? Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Typically aluminum packaging is actually a three (or more) layered packaging with aluminum not being in direct contact with the beans.  Aluminum is a superb barrier to air, and it is typically used as an internal layer to prevent air transferring into the bag, without being in direct contact with the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keys to optimal packaging:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prevent light from reaching beans.  Light will help to speed oxidation of coffee oils.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prevent air from reaching beans but don't restrict air from escaping beans!  This is where the 1 way degassing valve comes in.  Coffee will offgas carbon dioxide if it is fresh.  High CO2 levels contribute to oxidation, so you want the ability for that gas to escape without constantly recirculating air in your container (which would also contribute to oxidation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think ceramic or dark glass would both be excellent storage solutions provided they have a way to degas the coffee.  These materials (provided they have good methods of sealing the container) would prevent air transfer into the coffee, and would sufficiently block light to prevent oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of an aluminum coffee bag I snagged from the internet has a PET internal liner, Aluminum barrier layer, and an LDPE external layer. So.. basically aluminum sandwiched between foodsafe plastic and something that looks good on a shelf =p&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I do not even need tools to lock down threads, all are just tightened by hand and it opens easily again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually the manufacturers use something that I would recommend to avoid like the devil the water: PTFE/ Teflon. This locks things down forever. One winding too much and you will break your thread when trying to open it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; As grease, I can recommend to use silicone. The thing I used on my current machine is by &lt;em&gt;fermit&lt;/em&gt; again. If it does not get in contact with water, I would recommend using copper paste (for e.g. by Liqui Moly), which can be used up to 1.4k°C. You will need the grease only for the steam wand and hot water outlet. If you are unsure what to buy, search for (German/ DE) &lt;em&gt;Amaturenfett&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hahnfett&lt;/em&gt;, which is safe for hot potable water and is used for bathroom fittings and similar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;That is a simplified 'consumer' version of a coffee flavor wheel that roasters / importers etc use for trying to put words to a coffees flavor.  It is a really good way to try and explain the flavor of the coffee, but honestly, most roasteries won't have the development background or funds to make the fancy background on their products.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I run my own roastery, and happen to be a software developer as well and to get that to work on my site would take quite a bit of customization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to familiarize yourself with a standard SCAA flavor wheel and pay attention to the cupping notes on each coffee.  Here's the caveat.  If the roaster is terrible, his cupping notes (or flavor wheel graphics) will still probably say the same things as a roaster that is producing high quality coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you become accustomed to single origin coffees you will be able to immediately go straight to your preferred origins from each roaster faster.  For instance, I have a customers who will only drink Guatemalan coffee because it matches their particular preferences, the same for Ethiopian etc.  If you find that Ethiopian fits your preferred flavors, then you can explore more confidently knowing that most Ethiopian coffees will have a 'similar' flavor profile.  Not all coffees from a particular country will have the same flavor profile, but it's a good place to start if you are looking for something to fit a particular flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Use a wire brush and clean this blade. Remove it and&#xA;  clean the mount, put it back. Next remove the lower blade. To do this&#xA;  safely unplug from the mains.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;So.. I've done a lot of research on caffeine levels or at least reading various books that skirt the topic.  Interestingly, the caffeine amount in a particular roast is slightly different than most peoples conceptions, including my own up until a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, caffeine levels in dark vs light roasts are often said to be different.  From a chemical perspective caffeine is chemically stable to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (it's melting point).  Due to this, caffeine is not removed during the roasting process unless you are roasting to a Spanish roast, or burned beyond all recognition.  As such, the caffeine inherit in a particular lot of green coffee tends to stay the same amount per bean regardless of roast depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The twist..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roasting will roughly double bean size, and burn off between 12 and 18% of the total weight of a bean.  Due to this, technically, a darker roast has more caffeine by weight than a lighter roast, which is opposite of what I hear a lot of people say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now.. on to your question.. If the pods are by weight, I suppose a dark roast will have marginally more caffeine.  Where you get a significant difference in caffeine amounts is when you start looking at different types of coffee.  Robusta coffees for instance tend to be low grown and have adapted to the environment by having higher concentrations of caffeine.  The reason is simply that caffeine is the coffee plants natural pesticide.  That being said, Robusta coffees also tend to be very bitter, hence why they are predominantly used in cheap coffee blends in place of arabica.  The bitterness is directly related to the elevated caffeine, as well as very high concentrations of CGA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is pick what tastes good, because honestly, you aren't going to get a significantly higher amount of caffeine per roast, or lot of beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I could think of two possibilities. First one is more common, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time, the cup calcifies. So, some irregularities causes an unpolished surface. This surface catches color easier than polished ceramic/porcelain. You may try to clean the cup with vinegar. Maybe then with some bleach to get rid of such calcification and organic irregularities. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the grounds you use includes finer grounds that can pass through the filter, you may end up with a muddier-than-normal French press cup. Those fine grounds may swim on top of the water and leave some trace. If this is the case, make sure about your grind size and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Why does commercially brewed coffee taste so much better?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to figure out why coffee brewed with commercial machines taste so damn good compared to what I do at home. Whenever I'm out and about I always take note of the machines that are used in the brewing and some examples are WMF 1500S, Thermoplan Black &amp;amp; White and Franke A1000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm talking solely about black brewed coffee - no espressos or lattes. Whereas the coffee I get from these machines is aromatic and just the right amount of strong, the coffee I do at home is usually way too acidic and with a very long and overbearing aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I've certainly tasted bad coffee from these high-end machines it is never as bad as the coffee I do at home. I've tried researching how these machines work with the brew head and all but as I'm not an engineer I found that sorta stuff hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I've tried so far:&#xA;- 6-7 grams of coffee per 100 ml water&#xA;- Waiting 15-60 seconds after boil to allow water to cool down before pouring&#xA;- Different types of beans, usually pretty expensive (locally roasted, organic, non-organic, dark, medium, light, etc)&#xA;- Different ground levels for pour over&#xA;- Different brewing times (1 - 4 min)&#xA;- Probably a bunch of other stuff&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My kit is:&#xA;- Full Hario V60 pour over kit (w/ dripper, server, filters and kettle)&#xA;- Melitta pour over dripper&#xA;- Kitchen scale&#xA;- Wilfa electric grinder (cleaned regularly)&#xA;- Bodum french press&#xA;- Good water source&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that people seem to think that pour-over is better and more gourmet but I've found the case to be the opposite. I'm almost to the point where I'm thinking of buying an expensive fully automatic bean-to-cup machine...&#xA;What do I do here guys?

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Probably your grind, or your grounds to water ratio is off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I typically use around 8-9g grounds per 120g water.  At this ratio, you should be getting very strong coffee from a pour over system, and in general it should not be sour.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you are describing sounds like under extraction.  This could be caused by a number of things.  I will focus on the pour over system for now and outline possible issues below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water not hot enough:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  It sounds like your method is pretty good for this, but if you are getting sour/very bright flavors, then it is a possible culprit.  Lower temp water will extract fewer compounds per second than higher temp water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grind level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a high likelyhood, and if a coffee doesn't taste right, this is the first thing I adjust.  For pour over, you should be doing a medium to medium fine grind.  Each person / coffee is going to adjust slightly differently but if you are getting sour / too bright, grind finer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pour speed:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Pour over can be a bit of an art with the concentric circles etc.  You should be keeping the grounds saturated without having standing water above the grounds.  Pour too fast, and you will under extract.  Typically to brew about 400ml of extract, I spent 5-6 minutes pouring, maybe a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amount of grounds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  You may want to increase the amount of coffee per cup.  As I mentioned, with the coffee I produce, you should be getting a very bold cup of coffee at 9g / 120g water.  I typically tone this down and do maybe 24g for 360g extract?  It still comes out very strong.  If you make all of the above adjustments and still get weak / sour / bright coffee, start adding more grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your French press is brewing bright, then I would look to water.  French press grind is as coarse as most grinders go, and is very forgiving on extraction.  If you are getting bright / sour coffee in the press, make sure you are allowing it to steep for a good 4-5 minutes, make sure your water is just off boil, and make sure you are using enough grounds.  Again, start with about 8-9g per cup and adjust from there.  Personally I use 7 'scoops' which end up being about 8g each for an 8 cup french press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just 2 cents of advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;If you are just looking for a good cup of coffee in the morning, I would recommend simple.  I have French Press, Pour Over, Drip Brew, Espresso, Moka Pot brewing systems.  As a coffee roaster, I need to be familiar with all of the common methods of brewing coffee so I can answer questions that might arise.  I use a simple drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee.  I grind on demand, but it is not a bean to cup machine or anything like that.  Currently I use a Cuisinart with a vacuum carafe, and as picky as I could be, it is easy, and it makes good coffee.  Cuisinart and Bonavita both make pretty nice drip brewers for around 100 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm just reasoning...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Polished gold or porcelain must be the ideal stirrers as they won't chemically react. I opt for porcelain as it may also help keeping the coffee warm as its thermal conductivity is less than gold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the three you mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wooden: Sometimes I taste it.

Some of these things are really of bad quality and I am suspicious if their thermal resistance is adequate for coffee.

So, the only bad thing about them is, they may make your cup colder a bit quicker than usual. Just take the spoon off right after use.

Don’t think of it as a waste of beans. Gulping coffee without paying attention to flavor is a waste, experimentation is the best possible use of good beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've tried varying the grind size and water temperature in an AeroPress, and so far my results agree with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, I've found that brewing medium roast beans with 175°F water (using a calibrated thermometer) produces coffee that's not sour, while higher temperature water often produces sour coffee (tasting a bit like vinegar). The company recommends 175°F except with light roast beans, in which case some people prefer 185°F water. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt; about temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not tried varying the brew time. The &lt;strong&gt;inverted method&lt;/strong&gt; lets you increase the brew time but you can accomplish that without the mess by inserting the plunger, pulling back slightly to decrease the pressure below room pressure, then waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see that the brewing variables are interdependent. That probably explains why people using the inverted method to brew longer would use hotter water to compensate for what would otherwise be over extraction. (I don't know why cooler water extracts more than hotter water.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ideal brew time, temperature, and grind size will vary with brew method. AeroPress immerses the grinds in water, thus it's relatively insensitive to grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It is certainly &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to avoid using a cone, and I have also done this in a pinch. Though it works, &lt;strong&gt;there is no real benefit to using a bare filter&lt;/strong&gt; (that is, using a paper filter without a filter-holding cone or other device) as far as the brew/outcome is concerned (other than the obvious, trivial facts of less equipment and not having to clean the cone). There are other &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; to not use a cone, and there are also a few downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main downside is that &lt;strong&gt;paper filters are quite flimsy&lt;/strong&gt;, especially certain brands and types (e.g., Hario V-cones are very thin as compared to thick, almost fabric-like Chemex). They are meant to be used with a supporting cone or basket. With support, they hold together nicely. Without support, they can easily rip, be otherwise damaged, or collapse when filled with water. The consequences are natural: contamination of brewed coffee with grounds, spilled near-boiling water, or other mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One might argue that you have better control over the speed or length of infusion, but the coffee will not drain as well or as quickly. You can precisely control the length of water/grounds contact with reasonable pouring methods. The ridges on the cone filter (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2013/what-purpose-have-those-grooves-inside-the-dripper&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex/&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; question) help to wick the coffee away from the filter so that it drains better. You can also find cones that have a drain plug (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00EOM5RN0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt;), so that you can steep the grounds for some time before draining, but I don't believe in that either. No matter what, I argue there's no benefit to a bare filter for this reason either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are reasonable ways to use a bare filter. I sometimes use &lt;strong&gt;a bare filter for cold-brewing&lt;/strong&gt; coffee without other equipment: I use a large basket-style filter (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006VNO7Y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;arbitrary example&lt;/a&gt;) with some grounds, then tied up with a piece of kitchen string into a small sachet like a tea bag, then submerged in a jar of water (see other &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/cold-brew&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cold-brew&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cold-brew&lt;/a&gt; questions, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/431/how-can-i-make-filtering-my-cold-brew-easier&quot;&gt;my problems&lt;/a&gt; with same). However, I still have to be very careful to prevent the filter from tearing when removing it from the brewed coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your friend is clever and plucky for sure; however, I don't think your friend's method is going to catch on at your local coffee shop as the next fancy brew method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The instructions have poor wording, instead use 7g PER 180ml of water, and make as many cups as you like / your french press can hold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I use an 8 cup french press, I use roughly 50g of coffee, and fill with water high enough to be full when in full bloom (about 30 seconds after you add water and the coffee is expanding, and letting off c02) After about 45 seconds, I give it a quick stir, and top the french press up with about another ounce or so of water and cover for 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of coffee per water is a suggestion ONLY.  Typically I recommend 8-9g per 120g of water (If I recall, SCAA standard is 9g per 120g water?)  Use it as a starting place, and adjust based on your taste, and how much coffee you want to brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just a note, I go lighter than my suggested ratios in a french press because it brews stronger.  The 8-9g works well with a drip brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh.. one other thing!  You are going to have a hard time making &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt; coffee, unless you consider tasting bad dangerous, so don't worry about it being a risk if you are adding too much coffee.  If you stick to the rough suggestions in this post, and other comments on this thread, you are going to get in the ballpark of where you are wanting to go, and then you just fine tune to your personal preference.  And if you manage to make truly dangerous coffee.. make sure to repost the recipe.. I think I could use some of that right about now!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first attempt, I brewed it exactly like I brew my normal (water-based) coffee. I used a French Press with a light/medium roast, heating the milk in Pyrex in a microwave. The milk heated unevenly, curdling in places. Luckily, the curdled bits stuck to the Pyrex and I was able to make a passable cup. The thickness of the milk meant that it didn't want to pass through the mesh when pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The predominant flavor was that of the milk. I could barely tell it was coffee, though it definitely absorbed &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; flavor. The texture was about what you'd expect--&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; smooth and rich. It was the kind of drink that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my first attempt, I learned that milk is able to absorb and mask coffee's flavor incredibly well (after all, it's what people use to tone down overly strong coffee). This time, I heated the milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently (a rather long and annoying process for a single cup of coffee). I probably could have gotten it a bit hotter, but it worked well enough. I nearly doubled the amount of grounds and brew time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time, it came out with a distinct coffee smell, and about the same texture. Again, the initial flavor was that of the milk, but it had a smooth, subtle, and quite pleasant coffee aftertaste. I never got that bad taste you sometimes get a while after a normal cup of coffee--instead, the residual flavor was like you had just taken a sip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't want milk-brewed coffee for my morning cup. It feels more like a drinkable dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anyone else wants to try this, I recommend using some stronger/darker coffee. I didn't have any dark roast on hand, or I would have tried it. Give it time to brew--more than you would with water. Be patient when heating the milk, or you'll end up curdling it and ruining the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could probably work as a dessert drink if brewed with some spices in addition to the coffee. If nothing else, I'd say it looks pretty cool as you can see in the attached image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried this again today with espresso coffee (Cafe Bustelo), and it turned out great. The end result was like a latte but more... dull, or smooth. I don't know how exactly to compare it. Espresso grind is definitely the right choice when brewing with milk--it's the only thing strong enough and with the right flavor profile to stand out in the milk and complement the milk's flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be warned, though, that the fine grind of espresso coffee means you will need to use a paper filter at some point along the way. Sticking a paper filter in a French Press doesn't work because of how resistant the milk is to going through the filter. It seems to jet around the sides, allowing the espresso to slip through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0LEw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0LEw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;French Press&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Ideally you ought to store your coffee in a vacuum-sealed container that won’t impart unwanted flavors to your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Placing your coffee into the fridge, as many people do, isn't usually a good idea. The fridge is not cold enough to keep the coffee fresh and the coffee will absorbs odors and moisture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One solution, in addition to better sealing your coffee, would be to buy whole beans and grind your coffee before you use it instead of grinding a week's worth of coffee at one time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If any of you are familiar with the local coffee chain in Yokohama Japan, called Coffee Tonya, they have this speed roaster that roasts the beans you choose from their great selection of beans from around the world. I'd never seen one before, and I'm not familiar with the machine, so I'm not sure if the design and make is proprietary. But the roaster can roast the green beans to your desired roast in nearly 2 minutes flat &amp;amp; that is quite impressive, since you can choose from a light to dark roast gradient. I've purchased beans from a branch in the Philippines, had about 250g of Brazilian beans city-roasted (on the dark side), and must say that the result delivered a balanced flavor, without too much bitterness in the brew, creating a good bloom (pour over) &amp;amp;/or crema (Bialetti Brikka), and a pretty good expression from the roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask if anyone is familiar with the process of this quick-roasting style, and if there are any inherent differences that could come from this speed-roasted bean, as compared to a more traditional slow-roasted bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Roast times can significantly affect coffee flavors, and a 2 minute roast profile is concerning.  While I cannot say I am familiar with the process they are using, I do know a decent amount about the chemistry involved when you are roasting a coffee bean.  My biggest concern would be internal development of the coffee bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To give you a brief run-down of roasting, without spending hours on this post..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You typically have two types of heat in roasting, conductive and convective.  There are disagreements on how best to apply heat to a coffee bean, but the traditional understanding is you apply conductive heat early in the roast and convective at the end.  The reason is because if you do not dehydrate the internal bean, you will get an insulating barrier of zero moisture encapsulating the moist interior of the bean that will result in underdeveloped flavors (sour, acidic)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you apply too much convective heat early on, then this will typically happen.  If you apply too much conductive heat, you usually get what is called tipping which can be seen on the ends of beans as a small black spot where the plant would actually sprout had the bean been planted (this is a natural weak spot in the cellular structure that allows the plant to sprout).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To roast a coffee bean from room temp to ~400F give or take 25 degrees in 2 minutes would require an average rate of rise (RoR) of 115 degree / minute.  To give you an idea of the difference, The highest RoR I typically roast at is about 36 RoR and maybe an average RoR of 15 or 20.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My initial reaction to application of heat so quickly to a coffee bean would be that you would get over-roasted on the outside with possible tipping, and an under roasted interior resulting in sourness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that timing on airbed roasters is different from traditional drum roasters, but I've never heard of them doing 2 minute roasts either so I am guessing this is a proprietary roasting system of some sort.  That being said, if you want a pretty in depth discussion on how roast times affect flavor you can check out Modulating the Flavor Profile of Coffee by Rob Hoos.  He gives a very thorough break down of what happens when you trim as little as 20 seconds off a given segment of a roast profile and how that affects the flavors in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(btw, if I deviate from my desired roast level by more than 45 seconds, the beans usually end up in the trash can because I refuse to sell them)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Depends on if you want to be able to grind true espresso grinds.  My daily grinder I received as a wedding present and it suits me just fine, a Cuisinart for about $40 dollars.  If I want to grind for espresso, this is completely incapable of doing so, so I ended up getting a $180 dollar unit that is capable of timed grinding and grinding to espresso level grind.  This unit is a Breville with a cone burr, which I honestly really like because it doesn't have the static of the Cuisinart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is very much a personal choice type of question.  If you have $10000 burning a hole in your pocket, I'm sure you could find a grinder to match, or if you are worried about keeping the lights on, you could probably find one to suit your needs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few recommendations..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low End:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Cuisinart DBM-8 -- Does good coarse grind, to a reasonably fine grind.  Drip brewers and pour over are right in the middle of its standard grind range.  Biggest con is it is a flat disc grinder and generates quite a bit of static so be aware that it will make a bit of a mess.  Cannot grind espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid Range (150-250)&lt;/strong&gt; -- The Baratza Encore is really popular and a pretty good price.  It has conical burrs and gearing specifically intended to reduce static and heat.  I personally use a Breville Dose Control Pro which is about the least expensive grinder I could find with the portafilter holder and timed grinding.  Thus far I've been happy with it, low static, very very fine grind level for espresso if needed, but I am seeing some reviews about how the internal components tend to fail after extended use.  Someone may be able to comment on the feasibility of the Encore for espresso grind better than I.  Breville can grind espresso, someone please comment on Encore / Virtuoso espresso grind capability!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Range&lt;/strong&gt; --  The sky is the limit here.  You could go with a higher end Baratza going all the way to the 1000 dollar range and probably higher, if you've got that $10,000 dollars burning a hole in your pocket you could go big with a 60 lb EK43 (and then send me a big tip!).. just kidding.  The EK43 runs about 2500 and is a shop grinder, although it is now a barista favorite for competition.  When you start getting into the super high end machines, personally my favorite is Mahlkonig but really.. there's no reason for this caliber of grinder at home.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, how much to spend is a tricky question.  I would say a minimum of $40 and a max of however much you want to spend.  If you have the money, and want a solid reliable workhorse, I would probably go with either the Baratza Encore or Baratza Virtuoso.  Baratza is one of the higher quality, and popular home grinders that don't completely break the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="How to transport coffee"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid this is a dirty &lt;em&gt;instant coffee&lt;/em&gt; question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every morning I'm up pretty early and will usually make myself a quick instant coffee in a travel mug and hit the road. It is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good instant coffee, IMHO, and not only keeps me going for most of the morning but is also very tasty. But usually just after lunch I'm hankering for another, and herein the problem lies: most of the office are tea drinkers, and the options for coffee are limited to one &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; instant variety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't really be acceptable for me to bring in a jar of coffee (I know this would be fine in some places but I wouldn't feel comfortable with it in my workplace culture) so what I'd like to do is bring in a mix of my coffee contents to use in a one-off way. I take my coffee with two spoons instant coffee, three spoons sugar and about 40ml milk or so (it's quite a big mug), and would love a way to transport this concoction to the office daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would create a little sachet with all the ingredients inside but that doesn't seem like something I'd be able to do. I've also considered bringing it in in a tupperware or some other airtight container, but I think I'd struggle to transfer it all properly from the container to the mug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any coffee transporting solutions where I could somehow bring in all the ingredients I need, mess free, in my backpack?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Can you bring not in the mixed dry ingredients (your suggestion of Tupperware) and use the office milk (contributing to a kitty perhaps) ? That removes a large element of the messiness. However Tupperware can be quite bulky and isn't easy to pour out of sometimes. For handling those dry ingredients without mess I recommend baby food containers something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellobabydirect.com/tommee-tippee-closer-to-nature-milk-storage-pots-x-4.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;small, convenient, tight caps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would also mean you don't need to keep the mix cold as its only dry. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I advise against creamers as they just aren't that nice (I tried it). Pre-added milk does seem to get absorbed in the flavours and I think you'd possibly be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since its only dry ingredients, you can just wipe them clean. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I am based in Broken Arrow, OK but we roast our beans to order and so if you were to order coffee from my company, you would have it in your hands maybe 4-5 days after roasting which very well could be better than you might get at a local roastery.  We pride ourselves on freshness and quality so will throw away or donate coffee that has sat on the shelf for any appreciable period of time.  I am sure that we are not the only company that is this dedicated to freshness.  In addition, most roasterys have to give some sort of free shipping in order to compete in the online market space so depending on the size of your order, it very well may not cost more per pound than a local roastery.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Pour over systems give you the ability to control the water flow through the coffee grounds with a high level of precision whereas a drip brewer does not.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will admit, this is a bit of a trend, but there are very real differences in the taste of a pour over versus a drip brewed cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Blooming -- Gets rid of trapped Co2.  Easy to do in a pour over, whereas in a drip brewer, I don't believe the grounds are allowed to bloom.  If you don't let the Co2 offgas, you get metallic flavors in the cup.  Typically not really a problem since the majority of the gas is gone inside 12-24 hours anyways, but pour over allows you to completely optimize this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cleanliness of cup -- pour overs are known for producing a very clean cup of coffee, that allows you to highlight the top notes in a coffee like florals or fruit flavors.  This is the polar opposite from French Press, and drip brewers either use paper filters that aren't pre-soaked so may relay a papery flavor to the coffee, or use a metal filter which will allow quite a bit more coffee oil through the filter and thus muddy the cup (slightly).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grounds saturation -- Typically drip brewers don't have a very good spray head in the drip brewer, so many times you can get a filter of grounds where the center is indented after brewing and the outer grounds may not even be wet in some cases.  Obviously, grounds not wet is a bad thing.  The indentation is also a bad thing.  It basically means that more water is being passed through the center of the filter than elsewhere which means you don't get even extraction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Timing -- You don't want to pass water through the grounds too fast, nor too slow.  The reasoning for this is variable solubility rates of different compounds in the coffee.  Case in point, if you grind really coarse and 'brew' your coffee in 1 minute, what's going to happen is the citric and malic acids in the coffee grounds will extract very easily and the other more complex flavor compounds will stay in the ground.  This is going to produce a sour cup of coffee.  Pour over allows you to make minute adjustments to ground saturation timing that can produce some wild flavors in a cup of coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this being said.. I still use a drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee because I'm usually running out the front door trying to get to work.  Does my drip brewer produce a good cup of coffee?  Absolutely.  Can I get a better cup of coffee with a pour over?  Probably.  It's simply a quality / time trade off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There is no direct relationship between the names you mention and a roast level.  That being said, once you learn the characteristics of the origin beans, then many times those beans have a particular roast level that highlights particular flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are correct that the names mentioned are referring to regions.  Typically these regions have an overarching 'profile' that helps guide the customer to what they want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's take the Ethiopia Yirgacheffe for example.  Yirg's tend to have citric acidity, with berry and floral notes.  While Yirg's are roasted to all different roast levels, many times roasters will tune the roast profile to highlight the positive characteristics of the bean.  Meaning, I would bet that a large percentage of Yirgacheffes are sold at a light to medium roast level to highlight the clean cup, and lighter more delicate flavors in the cup. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is by no means a hard and fast rule!!&lt;/strong&gt;  Some coffees at light roasts highlight lighter fruits like pear, apple etc, and at darker roasts that flavor switches to a deeper development of stone fruit (apricot, plum, peach) or maybe a darker roast starts to bring out baking spice type flavors.  This means that certain beans might be offered in a light and a dark variant because they both have very positive traits on both ends of the roasting spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I pick a particular coffee, I never look for a 'light', 'Medium' or 'Dark' coffee.  Instead, I look for a coffee whose inherent traits align with my taste buds.  For me, I know that I will probably like a Guatemala Huehuetenango or an Ethiopia Yirgacheffe coffee provided it is a high quality bean and roasted using a good method.  A Sumatran coffee on the other hand tends to highlight very bold earthy flavors that I only prefer in certain circumstances (like when it is blended with something to balance it out) and so if someone is trying to sell me a single origin Sumatra (which isn't very common) I would probably pass. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to find out how the names correlate to what flavors, I would look at the product descriptions of various specialty roasteries online.  Typically a roastery is going to have cupping notes describing the coffee and you can, in general, get a feel for what origins correlate to what flavors by just reading.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Look for keywords Natural and Washed when shopping coffee origins.  A Natural Ethiopia Yirgacheffe has wildly different flavors than a Washed from the same origin (even the same farm).  Naturals use a dry processing method that essentially allows the fruit to dry onto the beans (and ferment while its drying) which imparts very fruit forward flavors.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of naturals since along with the added fruitiness, they also tend to get some funky flavors that I can't exactly describe.. basically flavors of fermentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

However, you cannot protect the brewed cup of coffee to go 'bad'. The reason is, whatever you do, you leave tiny coffee grounds in the water and they continue the extraction process. By time, your coffee gets bitter as a result of over-extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, this is a problem even in our daily routine. Pour-over brewing methods are invented for that. We mostly use paper filters to filter out most of the tiny grounds and have a clean cup to get rid of continuing extraction. Thus, we can have a stable cup while we drink in the next five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you follow your taste buds, you can clearly feel this in a Turkish coffee cup or French-press, as most of the tiny grounds are still in the final cup in a French-press (and all of them are still there in a Turkish fincan) you should be quick to drink it. Otherwise, the cup goes crap. (By the way, inverted French-press is can also be used to minimize the effect of tiny grounds. But not effective enough.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Late-brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everybody on this board could admit that after grinding coffee goes stale in a few minutes. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3715/how-quickly-does-coffee-get-stale&quot;&gt;How quickly does coffee get stale?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you grind the beans, the surface area increases so the delicious aromatics evaporate more easily. You probably will end up with a duller coffee experience at the end. However, I feel like over-extraction is a far worse problem in your case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Typically after roasting coffee there is a rest period during which you don't want to use the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 85-90% of carbon dioxide contained in a coffee bean after roasting will be released in the first 24 hours.  You CAN immediately brew coffee with fresh roasted coffee, but the flavors will not be fully developed, and you might get a metallic taste in your brewed coffee which is a side effect of the carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At my shop, we allow the coffee to rest for 12 hours before grinding for the customer, and we don't cup coffees until they have rested for a minimum 12 hours.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are some coffees that benefit from longer rest times.  Some recommend up to 10 days rest time for espresso because you will get higher extraction yields (tds yields) after a long rest period (per Scott Rao who is an expert on the subject).  Other coffees like some Ethiopians will develop more pronounced floral / berry flavors after a slightly longer rest period of around 5 days (recommended by Joe Marocco over at Cafe Imports if I recall correctly)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than this rest period and grinding, there is no process that needs to be accomplished after roasting coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Note:  I leave out a lot of the details of espresso shot extraction and just mention the major points of troubleshooting so don't flame me =p&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acidity is always tricky when you talk coffee because there are differences between perceived acidity and actual acidity.  Most coffees are slightly more acidic than milk, and they are in a very tight pH range.  When I talk to customers and try to describe acidity, I typically describe a spectrum where on one end, you have acidity, and the other end you have bitterness.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use identical beans, you will typically get the exact same amount of acids in your cup of coffee.  These acids are primarily Citric and Malic acids and they extract at relatively low temperatures compared to the other compounds in coffee which is to say, you can't use water temperature to change acid extraction without brewing at such a low temperature as to basically not brew coffee.  The caveat to that is cold brew methods which essentially trade heat for time and are known for being very low acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention better flavor and less bitterness in your espresso.  This indicates to me that rather than being concerned about acid extraction, we need to look on the other end of the spectrum and look at over extraction.  If you think about a coffee ground like a sponge filled with flavors, the first thing to come out is the acids.  This is why when you brew weak coffee it is thin, and tastes acidic.  The longer you squeeze the sponge so to speak, the more compounds come out, the last being the melanoidins that contribute body to the coffee.  Just like too much acid in weak coffee, if you extract too much out of the ground you will start getting bitter flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing is determining if the flavor defect is in fact acidity, or bitterness.  The biggest identifier for me is if it is overbearing acidity, I can feel it on the sides of my tongue (that's the sour receptors).  If instead you are dealing with bitterness, or charry flavor that is going to require the exact opposite to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a post where I was troubleshooting a particularly difficult espresso shot that gives a lot of the detailed mechanics of how to pull a shot, and what might be going wrong.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3518/what-is-going-wrong-with-this-espresso-shot&quot;&gt;Coffee SE Espresso Thread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lets say your problem is bitter espresso shots.  The first thing to check is if your beans are overroasted.  Presuming your input beans are good, and presuming the machine is functioning as intended.. let's go through how to troubleshoot.  Bitterness means overextraction which could be caused by a large number of factors, the top being too many grounds, coffee ground too fine, tamp technique, or even inserting the portafilter into the machine too early.  First thing is first, time your shot.  You should get roughly 2 fl oz of extract (2 shot glasses) in between 25-30 seconds.  Is it taking longer than this?  If so, this could be contributing to bitterness.  To remedy, reduce the amount of grounds in your portafilter, or grinder more coarse, both of which will speed up the extraction.  An additional complication, is if you tamp the grounds using too heavy a tamp, you can cause the extraction to run slow.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if you decide the espresso is too acidic, you do exactly the opposite, namely, tighten the grind, make sure you are applying enough pressure during the tamp, or even add a gram or two of grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonably simplified solution to troubleshooting espresso, but I hope it gives some insight into acidity vs bitterness, how to begin troubleshooting espresso shots etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The general recommendation for filter coffee is &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;60g coffee per 1000g water &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(And remember that 1000g =1kg = 1l.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the &quot;bath water territory&quot;, I admit that I have gone down to &quot;1 heaping teaspoon per mug&quot;, which translates to ca. 7g per 200-220g or 30-35g per 1000g.

Note that his coffee might (should!) brew differently from the supermarket sawdust. You might want to choose the right roast if you're going to lower the ratio. Tlk to your roaster: Factors that should be kept in mind are the type of machine and the fact that the water will probably be very hot, so the selected roast should be able to withstand it somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the grind will be important, but &quot;medium&quot; should be a good starting point. If your machine needs coarser grounds, you will have to increase the coffee by 5-10% to get the same result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if you did some test runs at home and think you perfected every parameter, that kind of machine you will be using is not designed to maximize the coffee quality, but the output - that's just how it is.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Actually, this answer will eventually boil down to the forecasting of time dependent expected coffee consumption function of your guests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may expect that, right after a meal or right after they are seated people tend to drink coffee all together at once. Therefore, it is better to keep most (all?) of the pots filled up when you encounter them at first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, the servers may check the pots and replace the most crowded tables' pots with empty tables' pots for a while. During that time, you may prepare your second tank of coffee brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep the coffee fresh, you may preheat the water, I assume. I'm not sure if your percolators are compatible but you may just heat up the water in the big one. Then use the smaller ones to brew smaller batches of coffee to keep rather fresher and smaller batches of coffee. Also, if some of the coffee remains, it is clear that a smaller batch will cost you less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides, for serving decaf, my approach would be something like that: I would keep a few of the servers busy with serving decaf around the less crowded tables and only leave decaf pots in the most crowded tables. (Assuming that decaf will be consumed less.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All and all, all of the above is my humble opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've read that I should &quot;wet the hopper&quot; in a large metal percolator (35-100 cuppers).  I think that just means I shouldn't put the coffee into a dry pot, but I don't know what good that does me. Is it possible (or useful) to bloom 6-8 cups of coffee grounds the way I would with a drip coffee maker and how would I go about doing that?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If you are using a 1:1 bloom subtract the mass of the coffee from the water you add to the reservoir. If you are using a 2:1 bloom, subtract twice the mass. Once you've added the coffee you will bloom it by pouring hot water evenly over the grounds. Because a percolator won't fit nicely on many scales, measure out your hot water first; this is probably easiest achieved by pouring into a pitcher on a scale until you've attained the equivalent mass of the coffee (or double). After pouring into the grounds, wait a minute. If you want to stir, stir. This might be a good idea because you are working with much more coffee than a standard pour over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Or has anyone ever stirred the coffee slush at any point during the brew process to favorable results? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm open to any answer really. I would very much like to hear answers from a practical standpoint (i.e. Will stirring make the coffee brew faster? Taste differently?), as well from a theoretical standpoint that Illustrates the pour-over for what it is meant to be, as a zen-like, artisanal experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy the process very much, so I'm really just curious if stirring has ever been a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Short answer, yes. There are a few differences. Does this differences affect the home brewer? It depends. Let me explain the differences in between the three main types of portafilters:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pressurized:&lt;/strong&gt; This type is mostly smaller in diameter (52 mm) and made partly from plastic material. As the diameter is smaller, keeping the pressure is easier even if the tamping is not even, grounds are not homogeneous in size. Thus, this is why this is the most common portafilter for entry-level home machines. It hides the irregularities. An example photo from Wikipedia is below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bY2W.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bY2W.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;portafilter and tamper, copied from wikicommons&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;regular:&lt;/strong&gt; This type is mostly made from pure metal and larger in diameter (58 mm). Thus, their heat retention is greater. This makes temperature equally distributed. This type is more sensible to tamping errors or grinding irregularities. But, this may be a good thing actually if you are looking for the perfect cup. Here is a photo I copied from La Marzocco website.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8w5rD.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8w5rD.png&quot; alt=&quot;La Marzocco portafilter, copied from company website&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;naked:&lt;/strong&gt; This type does not have the bottom spouts. This is very good if you want to see what's going on inside the portafilter. E.g. if you have problems in tamping, you can see if one side is flooding rapidly than the other side. Very good for education. Also, very nice for photographers. One nice photo including tiger stripes from wikipedia, again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UCJ5m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UCJ5m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Naked portafilter, copied from wikicommons&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Doing it by instruction gets me a full pot of something in the middle between filter coffee and machine espresso. A bit watery to my taste. I like it stronger. So I use hot water and cut the extraction short - as soon as it starts bubbling - pot gets cooled. Like that I end up with about 1.5-2 cups of espresso with a stronger taste just a tiny bit bitter, just the way I like it. A bit wasteful though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I bought a 1 cup pot, which is much smaller. The extraction process runs smoothly and ends up quicker. The bubbling phase is very short and happens at the very end. It doesn't dilute the result much. I get exactly 1 cup. The taste is just a bit weaker than what I get from the 6 cup one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is strange, the volume is 6 times less, but the end result is only half smaller. I'm looking for a happy medium, probably should go for a 3-4 cup or 2? What would you suggest to pick for a single espresso?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

And bacterial growth is what causes food to turn bad in two senses, namely &lt;em&gt;gross&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, although the two often go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The factors are:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;ood&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;cidity&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;emperature&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;xygen&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;oisture&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory it's sufficient to eliminate just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; factor to prevent spoilage, but in practical applications, it's often a combination of a few. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for your coffee, the main factors are &lt;em&gt;moisture, food and time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For your Nescafé, the granules are dry, have very little &quot;food&quot; for pathogens (proteins are a real problem, for example) and are around or slightly past the best-before date&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. If you say the coffe still tastes fine, I see no reason to suspect it to be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure about the second product, but will for now assume it's some kind of &quot;cappuchino mix&quot; that includes dry milk or another kind of creamer. My conclusion is largely the same as for the Nescafé product, but with a higher protein (&quot;food&quot;) and possibly fat content. So you have a slightly higher risk of &quot;spoilage&quot;, but it's not really about food safety, just rancidity and development of &quot;off&quot; flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up:&#xA;If your instant coffee still tastes fine, dissolves as it should and was stored in reasonable conditions (dry, room temperature, closed container), there are no food safety concerns. You might want to use it within the next few months, though, but mainly due to quality reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Another common misconception: &quot;best before&quot; does not indicate immediate spoilage after that date, it is a time by which the manufacturer assures you the product will be in excellent condition. This means also sensory attributes like taste or consistency. Plus there is always a safety margin included to be on the safe side, even if the consumer stores the product under less-than-ideal conditions.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Trading off taste difference against price depends on how much each of them matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storing an open bag of beans in the cabinet for 8 weeks probably does matter to taste, while a 4% price difference is easily in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Taste Difference&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;It seems fair to assume you care about taste differences since you're asking. So for that side of the comparison, it’s sufficient to ask whether you can taste any difference, and that’s fun and easy to test. See [this answer][1] on how to do a triangle test.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an experimental design for coffee bean storage duration: Weigh out the coffee into small plastic bags, put half the bags in the freezer and half the bags in the cabinet, then at different durations, defrost a frozen bag while still sealed (so the beans don't get water condensation from the air), and compare the coffee it makes against a bag from the cabinet. I did this with medium roast beans listed as “high body” and “bold acidity” so degradation would be readily noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 2 days, we could not distinguish the frozen from cabinet-stored beans. (That rules out the hypothesis that freezing hurts beans, at least when defrosted in the bag.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 4 weeks, we still could not distinguish them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 12 weeks, all tasters could tell, and with high confidence. The &lt;strong&gt;frozen coffee tasted much better&lt;/strong&gt; than the room-temperature stored coffee. The frozen coffee tasted about the same as it did earlier (to the degree we can rely on taste memory) while the room-temperature stored coffee tasted completely flat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caveats: That was just one kind of bean, made just one way, with 5 tasters who are no cross-section of the world’s population. But each taste test got “statistically significant” results for a hypothesis picked in advance. Good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I doubled the duration between each test, hence I didn't test 8 weeks. The taste impact of 8 weeks storage is still in play. Do try the test at 4 and 8 weeks with your favorite coffee. For discussion’s sake, let’s call it likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Side note: If you want to stretch out the freshness of a 2 month supply, it’s viable to freeze some of it in small bags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Price Difference&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;Perception studies have a notion of “just noticeable difference” (JND). A smaller difference than that is unlikely to be noticeable (not the same as “measurable”). A starting assumption for a new domain is JND = 1dB (as it is for audio volume) which is about 26%, but a quick web search gets us a JND threshold for price from [Marketing As I know it][2]:&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why is it a 10% off sale fails to get your attention while a 50% off sale brings in consumers from the surrounding counties?&#xA;The reason the 10% sale does not excite is that it is below the JND. Research has proven that the JND for price tends to be between 20 to 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In context, a % comparison (whatever the percentage amount) assumes you have a budget or reference in mind for that expense. If the % difference blows your coffee budget, you could compensate by drinking less often, or better yet by making more of your coffee at home than from cafes. If you think of coffee as part of your overall food &amp;amp; drink budget, maybe you could make up a large price difference by drinking less soda or eating less meat (both of which are health and environmental improvements).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I assume by now you came to a decision so maybe this comes to late, but I think that you were on the right track anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let's clear up some misunderstandings first. The AeroPress as well as the French Press are full immersion brewers. That means that all the water is in contact with the ground coffee for all of the brewing process (not considering pre-infusion). They produce usually a full bodied brew with even extraction. They tend to be less delicate than your average pour-over. The difference between Aero- and French Press is that for the AeroPress the brew is filtered through a paper (or alternatively metal) filter. This filters better fines in your coffee resulting in a cleaner, more delicate cup. The French Press only uses a fine metal mesh as a filter that let's many fines pass. They are obviously in your cup, changing the texture plus they keep extracting, making the brew slightly bitter over time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The AeroPress is always a good choice, when it comes to brewing devices. It produces delicious, full bodied cups of coffee somewhere in between a pour over and a french press and is great for traveling. However depending on your ambitions you may want to consider a Hario V60 (or another drip method like Chemex, Kalita Wave etc.). Long term they grant you more control over your brew. Obviously traveling is more difficult as you may want to invest into a proper kettle with a gooseneck spout. It's also more expensive, because you will soon realize that you need the gooseneck kettle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the grinder, the Porlex Mini has a slight edge over the Hario in my opinion. The grind is slightly more consistent and it fits in the plunger of the AeroPress, which is great for traveling. However it is also more expensive (not so much compared to the new Mini Mill). If it's within your budget, get it, otherwise the Mini Mill is great as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, if your focus is versatility then AeroPress plus Porlex is the best option. If you are ambitious and portability is not that important than a pour over plus any of the grinders would long term be a better choice. However you will see that if you get hooked you won't have any problems investing in more equipment in a year or two and a AeroPress is a great way to start with specialty coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

However, I can answer the entitled question; &lt;em&gt;no, you shouldn't be dehydrated by consuming coffee&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous studies made on this issue. Some of them including sports area some others are generic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Paluska states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most commonly consumed drug in the world, and athletes frequently use it as an ergogenic aid. It improves performance and endurance during prolonged, exhaustive exercise. To a lesser degree it also enhances short-term, high-intensity athletic performance. Caffeine improves concentration, reduces fatigue, and enhances alertness. Habitual intake does not diminish caffeine's ergogenic properties. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physiologic effects of caffeine, but adenosine receptor antagonism most likely accounts for the primary mode of action. It is relatively safe and has no known negative performance effects, nor does it cause significant dehydration or electrolyte imbalance during exercise. Routine caffeine consumption may cause tolerance or dependence, and abrupt discontinuation produces irritability, mood shifts, headache, drowsiness, or fatigue. Major sport governing bodies ban excessive use of caffeine, but current monitoring techniques are inadequate, and ethical dilemmas persist regarding caffeine intake by athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paluska, S. A. (2003). Caffeine and exercise. Curr Sports Med Rep, 2(4), 213-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang Zhang et al. states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, there was no evidence that caffeine ingestion in moderation would impair fluid balance during prolonged exercise in the heat or during 3 hours of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zhang, Y., Carter, S. J., Schumacker, R. E., Neggers, Y. H., Curtner-Smith, M. D., Richardson, M. T., ... &amp;amp; Bishop, P. A. (2014).

South African Journal of Sports Medicine, 26(2), 43-47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Killer et al. states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is often suggested that coffee causes dehydration and its consumption should be avoided or significantly reduced to maintain fluid balance. The aim of this study was to directly compare the effects of coffee consumption against water ingestion across a range of validated hydration assessment techniques. In a counterbalanced cross-over design, 50 male coffee drinkers (habitually consuming 3–6 cups per day) participated in two trials, each lasting three consecutive days. In addition to controlled physical activity, food and fluid intake, participants consumed either 4×200 mL of coffee containing 4 mg/kg caffeine (C) or water (W). Total body water (TBW) was calculated pre- and post-trial via ingestion of Deuterium Oxide. Urinary and haematological hydration markers were recorded daily in addition to nude body mass measurement (BM). Plasma was analysed for caffeine to confirm compliance. There were no significant changes in TBW from beginning to end of either trial and no differences between trials (51.5±1.4 vs. 51.4±1.3 kg, for C and W, respectively). No differences were observed between trials across any haematological markers or in 24 h urine volume (2409±660 vs. 2428±669 mL, for C and W, respectively), USG, osmolality or creatinine. Mean urinary Na+ excretion was higher in C than W (p = 0.02). No significant differences in BM were found between conditions, although a small progressive daily fall was observed within both trials (0.4±0.5 kg; p&amp;lt;0.05). Our data show that there were no significant differences across a wide range of haematological and urinary markers of hydration status between trials. These data suggest that coffee, when consumed in moderation by caffeine habituated males provides similar hydrating qualities to water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Killer, S. C., Blannin, A. K., &amp;amp; Jeukendrup, A. E. (2014). No evidence of dehydration with moderate daily coffee intake: a counterbalanced cross-over study in a free-living population.

This means, as a typical 80 kg male, if you don't consume 4 cups of coffee one after another, it should not be a problem. In a few hours, some of the caffeine should be metabolize so you can drink some more. But I don't know the pharmakinetics of caffeine. Maybe a pharmacologist may answer better.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Ok - not having used one of these tabletop frothers, I don't really know how hot they actually get.

As it starts to heat, the proteins in the milk &quot;wrap round&quot; the air bubbles. If you do it right, these bubbles are nice and small resulting in &quot;micro foam&quot;. You have much more control with a steam wand as opposed to the whisk like implement in frothers.&#xA;You'll likely find the bubbles in the froth from your frother are generally larger and thus doesn't last quite as long or look quite as nice as that created by a trained barista in a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The natural sugars (carbohydrates) in the milk break down into &quot;simpler&quot; sugars with heat and enhance the sweetness of the milk. The steam wand introduces more heat and brings the milk to the ideal temperature (with monitoring). For comparison, I have an espresso machine at home, and I get my milk to roughly 70 C&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For full details of the science behind it - I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://clivecoffee.com/2017/06/the-science-behind-perfect-steamed-milk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site which seems to explain it relatively clearly if you're interested in more science detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I prefer to listen to hummingbirds outside the kitchen window than an espresso pump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness. You can feel the resistance of water flowing through the coffee. If you change the grind or tamping pressure, you get immediate feedback on how it has affected the extraction process. Grind beans straight from the freezer? It is obvious how temperature affects grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing Grind/Tamping combination. Perfusion is determined by the product of grind size and tamping pressure. If your grind is a bit too course, this can be compensated by slightly harder tamping. How do you tell if you have the right combo? Count how many seconds it takes for the first drop to come out of the portafilter on boiler pressure alone. I use 4 seconds as the magic number. If I switch beans and the time goes up to 7 seconds, I know the new beans need a courser grind or a lighter tamp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-infusion: Boiler pressure (1 bar) is perfect for pre-infusion. This allows the grounds to soak through to their centers before extraction begins. I count off 10 seconds of pre-infusion before pulling the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control of extraction time: How hard you lean on the lever will determine how long the extraction time is. I shoot for a total of 25 seconds from beginning of pre-infusion to the end of extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this becomes a flexible dance. Say you try a new bean but notice first drip time has gone up to 8 seconds. Reach over and tweak the grinder a bit courser. You know extraction time will be longer so shorten pre-infusion to 6 seconds. Use higher than normal pressure on the lever to keep extraction time to under 30 seconds. Extra crema from that higher pressure! Great shot but you know the next will be even better because the grinder has already been adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As satisfying as a heal-and-toe downshift in a decreasing radius corner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe not that good.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The moka pot is by design unsuitable for a cold brew. In a moka pot, the water in the lower compartment is brought to a boil and the resulting steam pushes the hot water through the grounds in the middle basket into the upper part of the pot. So no steam, no pressure, no &quot;espresso&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cold brew works by playing with another factor of the main parameters of chemical coffee extraction (concentration/surface area, temperature, duration), namely the significantly extended extraction time. But changing the parameters will also alter the ratio of the compounds in your final brew, also known as flavour profile. Cold extractions are famous for their lighter, more floral nuances - which in an espresso roast will be overpowered by the darker roast, hence lighter roasts are typically preferred for cold brews. Also, the grind for espresso/moka is a lot finer than for cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you want to try cold brew, find a suitable roast, grind it accordingly and follow a &quot;recipe&quot;, at least in the beginning, until  you gain some experience. You can also search this site for Q/As tagged &quot;cold-brew&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the moka taste in a cold version is what you are after, you could simply prepare a serving, store it in a suitable container (think mini jam jar or similar) until the next morning. Decide whether the flavour, which will change somewhat overnight, is to your liking. And our taste buds react differently to hot or cold food.- But apparently you ran that experiment already.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If both versions are not really &quot;your thing&quot;, you can save at least a bit of time by preparing the moka pot before you go to bed. Then, see if you can alter your morning routine so that you are using the n minutes it takes for the moka to sputter for some other task. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that at the same grind setting (medium grind), some coffee beans produce a ton of dust when ground, while others barely have any dust.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;Burr grinders&lt;/strong&gt; are known for more precision and consistency than blade grinders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I haven't tried a blade grinder, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.specialty-coffee-advisor.com/how-to-grind-coffee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Specialty Coffee says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, once the grinder is loaded, don't just hold the button down and let it rip... use short bursts of a few seconds each so the coffee doesn't overheat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have a hold on the top of the unit and give it a shake during bursts so that the grounds get well mixed while grinding. This will make the grind much smoother and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be careful that some &amp;quot;burr grinders&amp;quot; have blades and burrs.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;Cold beans&lt;/strong&gt; grind more consistently. Per &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/science/coffee-freeze-beans-grind.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But to achieve consistent flavor you may just need to chill your beans before grinding them. Colder beans produce smaller, more consistently sized particles when ground, yielding more flavor from less coffee, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24483&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Scientific Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As room temperatures vary and grinders heat up with use, the consistency of the resulting grind changes. That’s a problem, because water extracts flavor from smaller coffee grounds faster than bigger ones. An inconsistent grind means sour taste from the small grains, and a bitter one from the big, all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(But I'm pretty sure that last sentence is reversed.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that some grinders heat up with use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) Different bean types, roasts, and ages might produce more dust than others when ground, but I don't have good info on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think this is a rather broad question to answer. Are you looking for overall health effects of coffee or specifically for effects on digestion after eating?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the former case, recent research has delivered very strong evidence that drinking a moderate amount of coffee (about 3 cups a day) has strong positive health benefits, reducing premature mortality quite dramatically. Among others coffee likely has positive effects on cardiovascular diseases, can be preventative to some types of cancer and alzheimer diseases and has positive effects on diabetes. See for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2643435/coffee-drinking-mortality-10-european-countries-multinational-cohort-study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j5024&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2643433/association-coffee-consumption-total-cause-specific-mortality-among-nonwhite-populations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The latter case is less conclusive I think. There have been studies showing that coffee (the chlorogenic acid in it) reduces glucose intake from digestion. While a decrease in nutrient intake seems like a bad thing at first glance, it may be beneficial for patients of diabetes, because it regulates glucose intake after meals and may help in preventing spikes/drops in insulin levels. I guess for someone struggling to get enough nutrients (due to other digestive diseases for example) excessive coffee consumption could have adverse effects. For healthy people moderate amounts most likely don't have negative effects (see the linked studies). There's also some evidence that coffee has beneficial effects on your microbial composition in your intestines (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160509000166&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's some other less severe potential issues that might arise, like an increase in reflux symptoms, due to excessive production of stomach acid (however dark roasts of coffee might even have acid reducing effects).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So overall I'd argue that the potential health benefits by far outweigh negative effects, except maybe in some cases of pre-existing conditions such as diseases of stomach and/or intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gunter M. et al.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You should reduce your coffee concentrate by placing it in a vacuum to lower the boiling point of the water down to room temperature. Lowering the pressure of water decreases its boiling point. This way you will boil off the water quickly without adding heat and risking any changes in flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you can put your coffee concentrate in an oven on a low heat setting poured into a glass or ceramic baking pan to maximize the surface area. Use the convection setting if you have it. The added heat shouldn't cause too much of a flavor change since the coffee beans have been removed at this point and won't continue to brew/extract harsh flavors. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Its name is a play on the word amphora.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The cup was originally designed by Leslie Buck of the Sherri Cup Co. in 1963, to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops in New York City, and was later much copied by other companies. The original Anthora depicts an image of an Ancient Greek amphora, a Greek key design on the top and bottom rim, and the words &quot;WE ARE HAPPY TO SERVE YOU&quot; in an angular typeface resembling ancient Greek, for example with an E resembling a capital sigma (&quot;Σ&quot;, a letter pronounced like English &quot;s&quot;). The blue and white colors were inspired by the flag of Greece. The cup subsequently became the metropolitan area's definitive coffee-to-go cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sales of the cup reached 500 million in 1994 (when it was by far the most popular design for the company's cups), but had fallen to about 200 million cups annually by 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthora&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also found this article about its history and cultural significance posted on May 16, 2017 By Devin Gannon  at  www.6sqft.com:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.6sqft.com/the-history-behind-the-iconic-nyc-anthora-coffee-cups/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.6sqft.com/the-history-behind-the-iconic-nyc-anthora-coffee-cups/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notable extracts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In a city full of symbolism, from bright yellow taxis to black-and-white cookies, New Yorkers also find comfort and nostalgia in a certain cardboard coffee cup. Known as the Anthora, the blue-and-white drinking vessel first became an icon of New York City in 1963 when Leslie Buck, a Czech-American immigrant, designed the first ever to-go coffee cup to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops and diners (...) The height of sales was in 1994 when Sherri sold over 500 million cups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After the Solo Cup Company bought Sherri in 2005, about 200 million cups per year were sold. A year later, with sales at a standstill, Solo Cup decided to halt its large-scale distribution. The company kept the design alive by selling its licenses to souvenir shops and restaurants. For example, MoMA’s gift store sells a ceramic version designed by Graham Hill in 2003, and many online stores like Amazon and UncommonGoods sell similar products. And it’s been seen in multiple movies and television shows set in New York; actors held the famous Anthora in hit shows like the Sopranos, NYPD Blue, Mad Men, and Law &amp;amp; Order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The cup made an official comeback to the city in 2015, after the Dart Container company received many requests to bring it back to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The triumphant return of the Anthora cup to New York was announced in this article dated 12/17/2015 at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dartcontainer.com/news/news-archives/news-stories/2015/12/the-comeback-cup-an-iconic-product-returns-to-the-new-york-city-market/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.dartcontainer.com/news/news-archives/news-stories/2015/12/the-comeback-cup-an-iconic-product-returns-to-the-new-york-city-market/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Comeback Cup: An iconic product returns to the New York City market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The original is back!

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think your question may need a bit of disentangling, however I will try and deal with your main points. First there are several factors that influence coffee bitterness, and origin, albeit important is not the most influential factor. More on that later. Secondly it is not clear what you mean with &quot;mild&quot; coffee. Do you just mean &quot;not bitter&quot;? Because non bitter coffee is by no means necessarily mild. It can even be more flavorful with very fruity flavors and a lot of acidity, while bitterness may cover up a lot of these flavors.&#xA;Regardless of that I will now write some points about how to reduce bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica tends to be lower in bitterness and astringency than Robusta, because Robusta contains more caffeine and chlorogenic acids. So take care you buy 100% Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The roasting is a very important factor. Dark roasts are much more bitter than light roasts, while lighter roasts emphasize floral, fruity flavors and acidity. In my opinion most people who complain about bitterness in coffee could fix that by drinking lighter roasts. Unfortunately for most people roasted coffee has to look dark brown to almost black with a glossy surface. In most cases beans like that are over roasted. So  you may want to try your dads beans with a different roast profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How do you prepare your coffee? Bitterness is often a result of over extraction. Make sure you extract your coffee properly so you get a flavorful, but delicate and pleasant taste. You will find instructions for your preferred preparation method here on the stack exchange, on many websites of specialty coffee shops or you could ask in your favorite specialty coffee shop.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, origin can play a role in bitterness. Overall you could probably say (all else equal) that many african coffees are lower in bitterness and higher in acidity. You could try Ethiopian and Kenyan coffees. Ethiopian coffees tend do be very delicate, floral with nice acidity while Kenyan coffees are higher in acidity and fruitiness. Central or South American coffees are probably (all else equal) slightly more bitter, but if the roast and extraction is right, bitterness also shouldn't be an issue. They would have more nutty, chocolaty flavors. Of course there's exceptions. Panama Geishas would be relatively high in acidity compared to other Central American coffees (also much more expensive and the bean is originally an Ethiopian heirloom variety).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up though I would recommend you first focus on point one to three. In my opinion they are more influential here. I'm assuming that you are already using Arabica, but I suggest to try different roast profiles and recipes. If you already did that I would recommend you to buy some washed Ethiopian beans as they produce delicate (you could maybe call them &quot;mild&quot; although I don't think it's the appropriate term) cups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Why did espresso never catch on as a mainstream drink in the US?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I live in the US. During a recent trip to France, I was struck by the fact that espresso is the default coffee configuration there (i.e., if you order &quot;coffee&quot; in a restaurant without specifying further, espresso is what you get). And Nespresso-compatible coffee pods are sold in the supermarket for use in Nespresso-compatible machines, whereas in the US Nespresso hasn't licensed their system to any third parties, so it's still a specialty item. Presumably the same situation prevails in Italy, where espresso originally comes from. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the US, meanwhile, you can get &quot;espresso drinks,&quot; but that usually means espresso diluted in a large quantity of milk and syrup. Espresso per se is an esoteric beverage consumed mostly by a small number of enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of what motivates this question is that in some ways espresso seems tailor-made for the American market:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Invented out of a desire for fast service&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Involves large, complex machinery&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lends itself to quick consumption&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet here we are.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I’m familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/337/37&quot;&gt;what the bloom is&lt;/a&gt; and why we do it. But all of the instructions and guides about pour-over coffee I’ve ever seen recommend a specific &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to let the coffee bloom before continuing with the brew. 40-45 seconds seems to be the most common consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I have to assume that every coffee setup is going to be a little bit different. Small changes in the freshness of the beans, the size and shape of the grind, the temperature of the water, maybe even things like the mineral content of the water? - all of these factors and more are going to have at least some effect on how much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the coffee wants to offgas and how long it takes. So, “45 seconds” seems like a good guideline or rule of thumb, but I would imagine that some brews need less time and some need more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if I want to gauge my bloom time by my senses instead of by the clock, what should I look for? I have noticed that toward the end of the bloom, the coffee starts to make a faint crackling noise. As the bloom “falls”, it becomes flat, and then cracks begin to appear into the surface, and eventually it falls past flat and becomes a little bit concave. (When it’s flat and starting to crack it looks to me a little bit like a chocolate cookie. It makes me hungry in the morning.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s what I’ve noticed so far about the “phases” of the bloom. At which point in the process is it best to begin the rest of the pour?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The bloom should be 30s for V60 and 40-45s for Chemex and Kalita and 30s for full immersion methods (like AeroPress or French Press). Blooming is not just about degassing but also to saturate the grounds (which obviously goes hand in hand) and to start dissolving solid compounds (mainly acids and caffeine, sugars come later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you'd want to change, just to see what happens (I doubt you will make better coffee with blooming times that diverge a lot from those &quot;standards&quot;, since they have been proven to be optimal for the respective brewing devices used), then you could consider shortening the blooming time when the coffee is a few weeks old and has oxidized and degassed quite a bit. You notice when it stops bubbling, that would be a definite visual clue. If the same coffee that's been degassing until 30s (for V60), suddenly stops bubbling at 20s, you can try to reduce blooming time a bit. You'll run into trouble though, because your overall extraction time will likely be shorter until you figured out new grinder settings. The phases you describe really depend on the freshness of the coffee and the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it contains (darker roast would contain more e.g. because it's more porous). The slurry of very fresh coffee is still bubbly and has foam on top after 30s, not noticeably decreasing in volume, while a not so fresh coffee might fall flat after 15s already. I don't know what exactly you mean with cracks, I'll pay attention next time. More like holes where the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exits, but I do agree it looks a little bit like chocolate cookies, when the coffee bed fell flat and the gas has mostly evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can stir with a wooden spatula/spoon/chop stick to make sure you saturate all the grounds, but in my opinion that is not necessary and I've noticed that too much agitation somehow screws up the brewing, often over extracting. Which makes sense, more agitation, faster extraction. If you pour it nicely in concentric circles agitating the grounds slightly, you can manage to saturate all grounds without stirring and without agitating too much. That's ideal in my opinion, but the opinions on this point split widely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Prevailing wisdom is that it is generally safe to drink up to 4 cups of coffee per day. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug (stimulant) and typical consumption is alleged to have a number of positive health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;2015 Dietary Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; Advisory Committee recommended a similar limit.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A lungo is an espresso that is pulled for longer and thus more water flows through the grounds. Plainly speaking it's just a bad way to dilute espresso, because you are extracting more of the bitter compounds that you don't actually want to have in the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to fill two cups at the same time, you'll have to use a double basket (with two spouts), which means that you will also pull a double shot automatically. Using the double basket means that you also need double the amount of coffee as compared to a single basket (with one spout).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So pulling with a double basket will give you two separate lungo shots, one in each cup. If you put a large cup under both spouts you will get a double lungo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The better way to dilute espresso is to fill the cup with water (to your taste and strength preference) and pull a regular shot in the cup with water already in it in order to make an americano.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You have an upscale espresso machine with a standard, non-pressurized portafilter. So as you know there normally isn't any pressure in the portafilter when you go to remove it after a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghyTwFhqRo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Backflushing&lt;/a&gt; can only be done on machines like yours that have a 3-way valve. And it's basically just putting a blind (sealed) basket or rubber disc into the portafilter and pulling three short shot cycles. That is put the portafilter, with a blind basket into the group then let the pump run for about 8 seconds, then stop the pump for a few seconds. Then repeat two more times before removing the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This flushes out the brew path. Backflushing with water is safe but you shouldn't do a frequent chemical backflush on an E61 type machine. Most of the time this can be resolved by doing a backflush (sometimes you may need to do two or three backflushes) which will clean the brew path. When was the last time you did a backflush on the machine? You should be backflushing with plain water weekly. And with a food safe detergent every 200 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the portafilter does remain under pressure it means that the &quot;3 way over-pressure valve&quot; that normally relieves the group pressure is sticking. Or more precisely something in the expansion chamber is sticking or the internal E61 cam isn't moving completely smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to check for scale (mineral) buildup on an E61 machine like yours is to remove the gicleur chamber nut and mushroom at the top of the E61 assembly and visually inspect the removed parts and the group head internals which will now be visible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6RoH.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6RoH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you only fill it up to #2, then obviously all the water will be gone through when the plunger is half way down since the other half of the chamber will be filled with air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To press down the plunger of the Aeropress and thus all the water through the filter and grinds should take around half a minute if the Aeropress is completely filled with water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should not put milk in it. To make a latte just make a strong AeroPress coffee and put the milk (steamed or heated) in afterwards. That's how a Latte is done. Maybe some of the milk fat is stuck at the silicon part or the inside wall of the Aeropress. Just wash it well with detergent and it should be perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the water is pushed through too fast or too slowly, the usual problem is a wrong grind size. If the particles are too small they clog up the filter paper and if they are too coarse the water passes too easily. The grind can be anywhere from fine sea salt coarseness (I think in the US it's often sold as kosher salt) to French Press coarseness. If you go for a coarser grind add more coffee or increase brewing time. Lately there's a trend to use a coarse grind but a high coffee to water ratio.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Because they are low brow, that is lower quality and much less desirable. Robusta beans are generally regarded as inferior to Arabica and command about half the price. Many coffee producers will proudly proclaim that their coffee is 100% Arabica as a hallmark of quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arabica beans produce a richer taste and have a better balance of sweet acidity. Sugar, fruit, berry and chocolate flavours are common and the characteristic winey taste of higher of higher quality coffee is due to Arabica's excellent acidity. Also the much remarked upon and pleasantly appealing aroma of roasting coffee is due to Arabica beans. Brazil is the largest producer and Arabica beans represent 75% of all coffee sold in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robusta by contrast has a stronger, harsher full bodied and more bitter taste with a grainy flavour profile and earthy or peanut aftertaste. Traditional Italian espresso blends typically incorporate about 10% Robusta because Robusta beans create more crema. The majority of Robusta beans go towards the bulk manufacturer of instant coffee where price trumps quality concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robusta beans contain more caffeine, are easier to grow and produce substantially higher yields.

I don't normally tamp it, but smooth over the grounds with the back of a teaspoon before wiping the sealing face of the basket with my hand. I use a very small gas ring, with flames smaller than the base (a little smaller to start, reducing once the flow starts). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming there were grounds caught in the seal, once I took the seal out and cleaned it, before assembling wet.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Your intuition is correct, modifiers like sugar or creme will only obscure a lot of nuance so connoisseurs, professionals &amp;amp; judges will try new coffees or espresso as brewed without adding anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the quality of coffee and a person's preferences they may sometimes add something after the initial taste. And some connoisseurs may order something like an espresso macchiato (espresso with a tiny amount of textured milk) or routinely add e.g. one sugar when drinking a coffee that they are familiar with or just for variety. But in general the better the quality of coffee and the more serious the connoisseur, the less likely they are to be adding anything to their coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certainly if you are trying to discern what a new coffee tastes like, you shouldn't be adding anything initially (coffee roasters and buyers have a special method for tasting nuances in new coffees called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;amp;d=cupping-protocols&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;cupping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).

And it's worth noting that high quality coffee has a rich, winey base overlaid with desirable flavours and little, if any bitterness.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Boiler water level has a significant effect on steam capacity and temperature stability. It may also impact steam quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three steam characteristics to look at: the amount of steam available, steam power, which is pressure but it's easier to visualize this as &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt; and quality. High quality steam should be dry and saturated, not wet. Within the safe (design) operating range of water level for your boiler, a lower water level means that there is more &lt;em&gt;headspace&lt;/em&gt; or space for the steam. This means that you will have a larger supply of steam, higher quality (drier) steam and better temperature stability because it's easier to heat a volume of steam than the same physical volume of water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A higher water level will reduce the effective amount of steam available and tend to create wet steam as more water gets entrained into the steam. Conversely if your machine sees heavy use for espresso but not steam, you may benefit from a somewhat higher water level which favours water temperature stability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intended water level serves several masters as a espresso machine requires water and steam and of course safety, cost, stability and steam quality in an usable balance. On a single boiler machine you can't really increase the boiler pressure to increase steam power because it would make the machine run too hot for quality espresso extraction. In general, it is desirable to operate single boiler machines on the lower end of the safe water level range for better steaming ability.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However if you have a consumer machine with an inadequately small boiler you may find that lower water levels produce an apparently anemic steam jet. The proper fix for this would be a larger, more capable boiler but pragmatically a higher water level will then produce a more usable steam flow because the entrained water in wet steam has more inertia or &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; at the expense of less steam capacity and lower quality steam. Or to put it another way in a machine that has too small of a boiler you may need to keep the water level higher to get enough steam power but it will also degrade the steam quality and will make texturing milk more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Is quality (taste) a primary consideration or are you concentrating on yield and/or caffeine and don't care much about taste? You should also describe your brew method in detail, tell us how you are grinding your coffee, how much coffee and water you use (brew ratio) and if you measure it, TDS (total dissolved solids).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are almost certain to degrade quality if you press or &quot;spin&quot; your grounds to increase yield.

Pressing grounds will over-extract and create a bitter result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider brewing espresso, rather than coffee if yield is important. Better quality espresso machines will have quite dry pucks (grounds) and you have the advantage of a concentrated product, if that is a goal. Otherwise you can just add hot water to make an &lt;em&gt;Americano&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Long black&lt;/em&gt; which is an end product quite similar to brewed coffee but with the higher yield you desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that taste is important and it is to some degree for most people, then you have to consider the detrimental effect that pressing or centrifuging wet grounds will have on taste. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The generally accepted way of doing this is changing the brew ratio. The brew ratio is the ratio of grounds to water, typically denoted in grams.

Tamping the coffee will also affect the flavour of the coffee, because one part of water will extract from one part of grounds longer, producing an undesirable taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want stronger coffee, simply add more grounds to your filter basket. This way your water is not in contact with the grounds for too long, but rather extracts from more grounds.

Therefore, I'll try to answer as best I can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about some of your suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ideally, double-walled tempered glass housing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of an Aeropress is that is durable, fool-proof, and easily brought on camping trips or stored in drawers and backpacks. Along with being bulky, doubled-walled glass or stainless steel would add weight and fragility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;fine stainless steel filter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is definitely an option, and you can buy metal filters for a few popular brew methods including Chemex and Aeropress, and off course, french press is typically a metal mesh filter. The thing about metal filters compared to cloth or paper is that even the finest ones cannot filter at the same level. Metal filters will always let in more oils and fines compared to paper, and this is why the might not be desirable for an Aeropress, where clean, bright coffee is expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there any reason why cork wouldn't work for this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cork does seal well under the right conditions. But that's the key: right conditions. In a wine bottle, there is 1/2 and inch to 3/4 of an inch in diameter, and the cork is typically more than an inch long. It has also been created, molded, and formulated specifically for that task. A cork plunger would need to be thicker and be made specifically for that application to work, because you would't want it to flex and break the seal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, cork is terrible at remaining taste-neutral. Every cup of coffee you brewed would impart taste into the cork and negatively effect every other cup. You could prevent this by putting a layer of something on the bottom if the cork, but then you start looking at using plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for brewing methods similar to the Aeropress, I might suggest something like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rokkitchentools.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ROK&lt;/a&gt;. It uses hand pressure to extract espresso. No, i is not as easily carried around like an Aeropress but has a similar function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for brewers that have no plastic, well, there are many options in that field too such as french press, Chemex, mocha pot, espresso machine etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, you could try modifying a glass french press with some sort of cloth filter to create a sort of reverse Aeropress. You can try looking around other options online too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps to answer your question!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Kirkland coffee beans are charged?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Recently I noticed something interesting about Kirkland's coffee bean. After I ground the bean and dump on the paper filter, some fragments actually stuck to the wall of the filter - as if they were attracted/pulled by the wall and partially overcome the gravitational pull, instead of simply staying at the bottom.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed this couple of month ago, over time, I observed and can confirm that: this did not happen with other brands of beans - so I do not think that this is caused by the paper filter or the grinder. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not sure whether the ground bean is necessarily electronically charged, but that certainly can be a potential explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what caused this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Hi not likely to be a trait of kirkland beans or of packaging of the beans.&#xA;Static electricity can build up between the grinder and the beans. - you'll note that the beans will also stick to the sides of whatever receptical they get ground into. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Hack-to-Remove-Static-in-the-Coffee-Grinder/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;one hack to fix this at the grinder stage&lt;/a&gt; &#xA;it used tiny amounts of moisture that likely reduce what's happening in the grinder that casuses static electricity: two materials rubbing against each other - and yes getting charged and repelling from each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now maybe not all beans have this effect to teh same level based on moisture content - dunno - or perhaps its just humidity levels and grind sizes.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a few elements to this answer, so I'll try to tackle them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;is it possible to brew another cup with the used grounds...?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. It is physically possible to do this. Just do what you described and voila, more liquid into the next mug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;this would be the same as using more water and brewing over a carafe to brew twice as much coffee&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where you are wrong. Brewing coffee is chemistry, whether you are using a Chemex or an espresso machine or a cheap drip machine. Each stage of brewing produces different flavours from the coffee. I can't guarantee this is accurate but here is an example of what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first part of your pour controls the bitterness of the coffee. The bloom helps to get rid of CO2 and dissolves oils on the beans and in the grounds. It will develop your &quot;body&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part of your pour will determine the sweetness. Some people swear by small pours over a longer period of time, while others prefer the ease of just slowly filling the brewer evenly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last half of your pour controls the intensity of your cup. This is where your question comes in. More water in this last section will produce a weaker cup, and less water a stronger one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these parts of the pour need to be melded together to create a delicious cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pouring your first cup then re-using the grounds for the second one means the second cup misses out of the main part of the brew. Yes, the liquid will tastes like coffee, but will not have very much caffeine, and will lack the flavours present in a well-brewed cup. You're basically making ultra-weak, bland coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make more coffee and don't care about the strength, brew a larger batch into one carafe, then swirl and split it between tow cups. You should adjust your grounds-to-water ratio accordingly though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you answer your question!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Yes, it will still over extract over the same time period but will not be as strong. This is probably the worst option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, brew faster. I know that in a Dutch Brewer this is more complicated than just letting it sit for less time. If there is a way to put more water through the grounds in less time, you will want to go with that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, use a different brew method for the finely ground coffee and buy new coffee for your Dutch brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

However I am unable to drink straight coffee, because it is so unbearably bitter for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no-one is compelled to drink coffee - and I'm perfectly fine without it. However so many people enjoy this drink so much, and it would be nice if I could experience the same pleasure. The fact that I like the &lt;em&gt;flavour&lt;/em&gt; of coffee (as when eating a coffee-flavoured sweet) tells me that if only I could find a variety of the drink which did not include the bitterness, then I would enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have asked this question of several people over the years, who have suggested that I try latté, for example - however the fact that the coffee is diluted by a large amount of milk does not solve the problem. It means less flavour - and yes, less bitterness - but the bitterness is still there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day I was recommended to try an Ethiopian coffee called Bukeela. I was told that this was especially weak, and that I might be able to take it. So.. I tried it. I added lots of sugar. However it was still too much for me. Yes, the coffee was weak - but that just meant that the flavour was weaker. The bitterness was still present, and still made me unable to drink it. The sugar did not help. It simply meant that I had two tastes in my mouth simultaneously: sweet: but still bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: the related question on this site regarding &quot;sweet coffee&quot; does not address my question. Sweetness isn't the same thing as non-bitterness. As stated here, even if I add lots of sugar, I just get 2 tastes simultaneously: sweet and bitter. The bitterness is still there. That other question doesn't mention bitterness at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that my taste buds are &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; sensitive to anything bitter. I can not drink beer, and I dislike certain vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, because of their bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the question for all you coffee experts is: does there exist a variety of coffee which retains the yummy flavour, but which has &lt;em&gt;no trace&lt;/em&gt; of the unpalatable bitterness?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;great question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that will give your coffee the flavor and such that you want.  To fully answer your question, we also need to understand some of your preferences and the answer may change slightly depending on your those.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One General question is when you say &quot;bitterness&quot;, do you mean &quot;acidity&quot; of the bean, or potentially a taste associated with the water (hard or soft water taste, possibly acidic water or akaline water)?  You may not know or be able to pinpoint what I mean.  I get two different flavor results from when I brew at work versus when I brew at home in the same french press with the same beans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally find that some of the bitterness is caused by the process of brewing, which has a few factors.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I personally enjoy the French Press, which not everyone has the availability or patience to do that.  I found that the French Press makes the taste stronger, but less bitter, and I can dial back the strength of the flavor based on the amount I use in the french press.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Along those lines, the &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; you use can make a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; difference as well.  I try to make sure my water is always purified and from a clean container, and that the temperature is not too hot (personally between 180-190).  I worked at one place that had Keurigs, and some of them had the water container on the side.  I would have to wash those out and flush out the water inside before I got a &quot;clean&quot; non-bitter tasting cup of coffee, although they were used all day.  The company eventually switched to having an in-line water supply and filter for the Keurigs which greatly helped (when the water filter was clean).  Another company I worked for only had the &quot;Bunn-O-Matic&quot; and the bitterness was also caused by a build up of calcium inside the brewer as well as too hot of water (200F+).  I adjusted both of those things and would clean out the brewer weekly and people flocked to the coffee station after that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee type I think can be a factor depending on your method and your preference as well.  A few friends like lighter roasts so they don't get the acidity of the roast / coffee, which they consider to be the bitterness.  Some of those friends will also swear by &quot;flavored&quot; beans/grounds, as typically those are lighter roasts and the flavor will some of that bitterness they are referring to.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mysticmonkcoffee.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mystic Monk Coffee&lt;/a&gt; and I find them to not be bitter for both their regular blends and their flavored blends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last suggestion, I have another friend and his wife both love Columbian coffee because of the flavor and it doesn't have the acidity, but it has some bitterness with the coffee flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

There are electric Moka pots that have the stove already built into them. Bialetti is the go to brand for Moka pots. I'm certain that they will fit in your office, even on your desk if need be. Alternatively you can get a small electric stove for the Moka pot you already have. It will also fit on your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option would be portable espresso makers. Handpresso Wild Hybrid and Wacaco are the only ones I know of. I've heard good things about the Handpresso, but can't attest to them since I haven't tried one yet. They work with pressure, which the Moka pots don't do, so they should come closer to Espresso from a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However I personally would stick with the AeroPress. In my opinion it makes by far better, more complex coffee than the other options.There are also some tweaks, like using two filter papers, using a metal filter, very fine grind size, tamping the coffee, high coffee to water ratio and tweaks/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIfZ84qtBOc&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;constructions&lt;/a&gt; to apply more pressure, that make a more espresso like drink. Note however that the AeroPress is not built to withstand several bars of pressure and constructions like the one in the video are neither practical, nor safe. The other tweaks mentioned however can safely increase pressure to a point where you get pretty neat, espresso like results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

When I take the group handle out after a failed attempt there is a squeak noise so there definitely water built up under some sort of pressure.

It could of course be the pump, but then water would definitely flow out if you run it empty and the single basket should be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's clogged filter you can try soaking it in hot water with an espresso machine cleaning detergent over night. But since you already soaked it in vinegar I don't think that would be fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also, carefully, put the porta filter over a gas stove to burn the residue. Hold it over the flame for a bit until it gets hot enough to burn it, then tap it against your kitchen table or some other heat resistant surface. That should do the trick. Afterwards you can clean it again normally and it should work again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly you can of course push through the holes with a very thin needle, but that is quite tedious work and would take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Coffee cannot taste like distilled water. It's not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think what you mean is that the coffee in question tastes too clean or too dry. That can be caused by using filtered water with too low dissolved solids or water with too high sodium content. The best water to use for brewing is generally thought to be hard water rich in magnesium and calcium, with no chlorine and low sodium content. If the dry, flat taste of coffee bothers you, try using mineral water, or, if you really want to experiment, buy water additive made specifically for making brewing water like Third Wave (you can find it on Amazon). You mix this additive with distilled water to create mineral water. You can also make your own water additive with 0.75g epsom salt and 0.36g baking soda per gallon of distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water quality is very likely the problem if coffee consistently tastes flat, dry, or &quot;clean&quot;. The only way to test this is to try the same brew with different water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Regarding the pre-ground coffee in a French Press, the website, packaging and company all say its suitable for a French Press / Plunger.  Technically it is, the big thing is usually the finer grounds being sifted through the filter and into your cup of coffee.  Most people don't like this, I personally don't mind this, though I do prefer not to have grounds in my coffee.  If you were to grind your own coffee, you may still get some finer particles pushing through, but not as much  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I too use a French Press and I noticed some odd things similar to the oily film when I first started.  I changed a TON of what I was doing, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what caused that to stop.  Here is a few things.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The grounds of the coffee could be part of that film.  As they sift through, some of the finest particles could be coalescing together and forming what looks like an oily film.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Try different grounds (just for a day, change it up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The appearance of that film could also be due to the sheen of the bean from processing.  Many flavored coffees, even a subtle flavor or a &quot;non-flavor&quot; from a large company, are from the beans being in a flavor oil.  This being Lavazza, I see that it tastes like Pralines, which could be some of the flavor of the oil the company uses to mask any bitterness or roasting flavors.  Not all companies do this.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Possibly email company and see if they do add any oil to the coffee (even if its natural or during the roasting process)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check the cleanliness of the french press and coffee cup.  I wasn't washing mine thoroughly enough at the beginning and some of that was a residue from soap I am sure.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Try to fill the french press or coffee cup with water after washing, let sit and see if it produced film&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dish Washer and detergent.  I had an apartment that had a dish washer and when it started to &quot;go&quot;, it would still &quot;clean&quot; things but we would notice that everything had a film on it that was pretty much invisible.  We could tell because we would pour a glass of water, then see the film a couple minutes later.  Sometimes it was obvious.  It could also be the detergent in the dish washer.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Try to hand-wash your coffee cup and french press and see if that makes a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check the water.  You may not have control over the water or the quality of the water, but that can play a factor in that oily film.  If the water is not purified or already has a residue, then your coffee will be the same.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Pour a glass of water from the same source and let it sit for 15 minutes and see if you get a film.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bag, packaging and storage.  I have a coffee vault for one of coffee's, and when I ran out and reordered more I put a different bean in there.  The previous bean was flavored and some of the oil from the flavor rubbed off on the sides, which then transferred to the new unflavored beans and caused some oily film.  So again, make sure its washed well.  But also, I noticed some bags or packaging have a metallic looking liner inside the bag, and that I feel is often oily.  I am not sure from what or why, could be a preservative coating or just some oil so there isn't bean on metal contact.  That may also transfer to the bean as well.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Check the inside of the bag and see if that has any oil residue inside.  Also email company see if they coat the inside of their packaging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lastly, I forgot, but this goes with washing your french press, wash it as soon as you are done.  Out of forgetfulness or laziness I have left my old brew in there overnight a few times, and I have noticed that the next one may have some residue from the previous still, which may be some of that oily film.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Try washing right away after done with coffee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck, hope this helps and try to keep changing things and see what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

As far as the final product is concerned, it doesn't especially matter if this happens in a machine that dispenses the hot water automatically (drip brewing), or if you pour the water yourself by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only reason coffee grounds might be suitable for one but not the other would be if you use different filters for drip brewing and pourovers.  For instance, if you have a drip coffee machine that takes paper filters, but a standalone metal mesh filter that you use for pourovers, you would want to use slightly coarser coffee grounds for the latter.  Even in this case, though, the worst possible outcome would be that your coffee might be a little cloudy or gritty, just like if your grounds were slightly too fine (because that's exactly what's happened).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;To answer this it's important to understand what Crema actually is. Roasted coffee consists of somewhere around a thousand different substances, among which are aromatic oils, sugars, caffein, fiber and carbon dioxide trapped inside the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crema consists mainly of those oils, sugars, some proteins and importantly the CO2 gas trapped inside the bean. When an espresso machine pushes water through the grounds with high pressure, it emulsifies the fats/oils, dissolves some sugars and traps it all in little CO2 bubbles. The CO2 is forced out of the grounds through the high pressure. That's why you have considerably less crema if you use old, stale coffee. Because most of the CO2 trapped inside has evaporated already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to your actual question. For the obvious reason, that is the lack of pressure in a French Press, Crema can not form. There can be some kind of foam, just as with pour overs, but it's not crema. It's not going to last long and will usually dissolve very quickly. If you were to create such a pressure in a French Press (which I highly doubt is technically even possible, since after all you want to brewed coffee to go through the mesh filter, but not the grounds), you would likely have crema forming on the bottom where the grounds settled and then rising to the top, just as it does when you pull a shot of espresso. Order an espresso shot in a transparent shot glass once and observe how the coffee flows out in the beginning as a mixture of coffee and crema and then observe the crema rising to the top, I heard people call it Guinness effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's just a matter of tradition, style and skill. Traditionally the thick, hard foam with bigger bubbles is used in Italy for Cappuccini. Same goes for espresso macchiato. Sometimes the milk foam is spooned on top of the espresso. In other countries they often imitated italian style coffee, which is why e.g. in Germany the foam is usually very thick as well. In Australia they developed italian coffee culture further and usually froth more silky (and make flat whites with it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to skill, it is much harder to produce silky foam than the &quot;traditional&quot; foam. You have to start with cold milk, then introduce air at first, but also not too much and lastly spin the milk/foam mixture to break up big bubbles and to work the froth into the milk. In order to do all that you have to get the depth of the spout in the milk right, you have to get the angles right and you have to be careful not to heat the milk too much, because otherwise the foam will become too thick and hard (and the milk will get bitter). For the thicker foam you can basically just put the pitcher under the steam wand, let it sit for a while and come back. Not gonna be pretty what you fine there, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third wave and specialty coffee shops usually froth the milk to a silky texture, so called micro foam. That's a different style and there several reasons for it why it is done that way. The most important one is that the taste is superior. Frothed milk above 70 degrees starts tasting bitter. Most specialty coffee barista probably froth the milk to somewhere between 62 and 64 degrees. That way you get a sweet taste and micro-foam. For the thicker foam you would need higher temperatures and thus destroy the taste of the milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Maybe you can put a filter both side to side and compare them :P &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I prefer the FS-100 (the square corners comes very handy when removing the filter), but given that all filters &lt;em&gt;have the same size&lt;/em&gt; (when it comes to filtering area), all of them should behave equally (except the natural vs bleached).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The basics of blending consists of finding the lost flavors of one specific single origin bean in another bean. Therefore perfecting both (or many) beans in the same cup. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result, a good blend mostly has many axes. For example, the timing is important. Palate has a base, mid flavors and finishing flavors. When you taste the cup you first taste the base, then the middle flavors. Finishing flavors remain for a while. A blend tries to balance this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the balance in between sweetness, bitterness could be managed with the selected single origin beans. Acidity or body could be set to desired levels. All of these could be crafted on all axes to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The espresso blend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the preparation technique, espresso is acidic and less bodily then its counterparts. As a result, when espresso blends are prepared, less acidic and more bodily origins are preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another observable difference in espresso blends is their roast. Darker roasts makes any origin less acidic and more bodily. So, many espresso blends are roasted a bit darker than normal to achieve a better flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

After preparing your coffee in a French-press, swiftly clean it and fill it with some milk. Pump the filter in and out for a while. This will inject small air bubbles inside the milk, so the milk quickly turns into textured froth. Then, you can use it as a topping for the previously brewed French-press coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not exactly same as any espresso-based foamy beverage just like cappuccino.

I searched through the site, interestingly cannot find a short, precise definition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;variety&lt;/strong&gt; is confused with single origin. So,  I would like to start with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taxonomically, Coffea genus has several species and we consume three of them as the &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt; drink. These three species have several &lt;strong&gt;varieties&lt;/strong&gt;. They may be thought as varieties of dog from a biological perspective. Same species, several properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For coffee though, the variety is not the only criteria that affects the quality of a bean. Cultivation, climate, soil, irrigation, harvesting, drying and peeling the fruit from the bean,  drying the bean are all affect the bean quality. So, if you have a specific &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; and also you can guarantee the region and the aforementioned process is stable for a batch of beans, you call them &lt;strong&gt;single origin&lt;/strong&gt; beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blends&lt;/strong&gt; are &quot;blends&quot; of several single origin coffee beans to produce the flavor characteristics of more than one single origin coffee.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;An Irish coffee is traditionally a strong sweetened (with muscovada or demerara sugar or syrup) coffee with a doubleshot of Whisky (I guess around 40-50ml for a glass of coffee of 150ml) and a layer of aerated cream on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The coffee&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what was used traditionally, I assume some kind of turkish coffee (or &quot;Cowboy coffee&quot;), where the grounds steep in water just of the boil for a few minutes or percolater coffee. Today I would probably use french press coffee or AeroPress with a metal disk instead of paper filter. You should keep in mind, that the coffee-sugar-whisky mix has to be higher in density than the slightly whipped cream. A pour over is likely too delicate (in taste and density). You also don't want coffee that's too strong (like espresso) because it would cover up most of the Whisky taste. Irish whisky tends to be lighter than Scotch or Bourbon. Add brown sugar to taste, but keep in mind that it is used to increase the density of the coffee-whisky mix as well, so one tablespoon should be added (for a glass of coffee as defined before).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whiskey&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well it's called Irish coffee, so I would use Irish whisky. However I'm sure it's worth experimenting with different whiskys, trying to fit them to the flavor profile of the coffee. If you have a very nutty, chocolaty Brazilian coffee, maybe a smoky, spicy Bourbon fits better. I don't know much about whisky though. I'd just try different things. If you are afraid of too much alcohol evaporating, you could just wait until the coffee is cooled down to below 79°C. You can't drink it before that anyways, it would be too hot. After brewing, add sugar to cool it down, then I would wait until it's somewhere around 75°C, add the whisky, which will cool it down even further. Guessing to just below 70°C. Add cream and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cream&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As said before, the cream should float on top without mixing with the coffee. Thus it has to be added after, which is usually done over the back of a spoon. It should be whipped lightly, but not too much either. You want it to be of a creamy, slightly aerated consistency. You drink the coffee through the cream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/how-to-make-the-perfect-irish-coffee-1.2912857&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; to a recipe similar to what I wrote, although theirs has some twists like nutmeg in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Most of the coffee syrups sold by big chain cafes are either traditionally sweetened or artificially sweetened.  However, the flavoured coffee they have &quot;on tap&quot; are completely unsweetened, which is what I seek.

Though I have come across lists such as &quot;other ingredients&quot; below the nutrition table.  Not too sure how to interpret that, as I do not view the nutritional table as an ingredients list at all.  Many syrups are general-purpose rather than being meant for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than continue running down what seems like a high ratio of information dead ends, I'm hoping to leverage the awareness of those who already enjoy healthy coffee flavouring syrups that are completely unsweetened.

If so, then this question is not nearly as open-ended as it may seem at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are a lot of studies out there - but ultimately it's personal.

I've never been to DC, but I just googled &quot;Asian supermarket in Washington DC&quot; and also &quot;Vietnamese supermarket in Washington DC&quot; and plenty of option show up. So it should be easy to pick one that's close to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than that vietnamese coffee is of the Robusta species and the roast profile is quite dark. So you can also just go to a well sorted supermarket and buy a pack of Robusta dark roast beans/grounds, preferably of vietnamese origin. It will be more or less the same as the coffee roasted by vietnamese roasters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Caffein, which is the main active ingredient in coffee is known to be dehydrating. However there is no conclusive scientific evidence that caffein intake in normal dosages has detrimental effects on the quality of your voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One study by Akthar et al. (1999) showed that the ingestion of 250mg of caffein, which corresponds to 2 to 3 cups of coffee, produced alteration in the voice of 8 individuals. I would take this result with a grain of salt though, since a study performed with only 8 subjects, without control group or anything, can hardly be called representative or conclusive in any way. Also they say that the effect produced varied substantially between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another study by Franca et al. (2013) is showing that the ingestion of 100mg of caffein shortly before using your voice does not have any negative effect on the quality of your voice. I think this is a more plausible study design, 100mg corresponds to a cup of coffee and the experiment is controlled with one group taking placebos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally a recent review (Alves et al. 2017) of the literature on dehydration and vocal quality found that dehydration is, surprise, bad for your voice. They also found however that &quot;systematic hydration is the easiest [...] solution to improve voice quality&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus I would conclude, that as long as you take care to stay hydrated, meaning drinking water with your coffee (which everyone should do in any case) moderate amounts of coffee consumption will likely not have any detrimental effect on your voice quality. The evidence for that seems to be mainly anecdotal and not scientific. If you struggle with some vocal chord disease for example or you are in recovery of one, maybe coffee could be ill-advised. Akthar et al. (1999) hint to something like that. There's no proof that it's damaging in those cases either, but just for the sake of being overly careful rather than ending up doing damage (anyways it would likely be only temporary) to your voice, if you are professionally dependent on it, maybe restrain from coffee consumption in cases of diseases etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akhtar, S., Wood, G., Rubin, J., O'Flynn, P., &amp;amp; Ratcliffe, P.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Making coffee is all about extraction. The compounds you find in coffee beans that add flavor dissolve at different moments of the process. Some dissolve almost instantly when the coffee grounds come in contact with water. Like for example caffein and the more acidic compounds. Others take a while before the water dissolves them, like bitter compounds and sugars. The goal is to have an even extraction. To get the best possible flavor out of the coffee. You want some sugars in there to give it sweetness, but you don't want too much bitterness. You want fruitiness and acidity, but you don't want it as sour as lemon juice. So you need to balance the extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are different variables influencing this process, but they all come down to how fast and much extraction is happening. The grind size, the water temperature (and mineral content) and the brewing time just to name the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wetting the grounds, or blooming, is preparing them for the extraction. When coffee is roasted CO2 gas is trapped inside the beans. Wetting the grounds, without water passing through the filter (for drip coffee where blooming is most important, certainly more than for full immersion techniques like French press) has the effect of the CO2 being released to ensure an even extraction when you are brewing. There are several straight forward reasons for that and some more technical ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blooming prevents channeling of the water (the phenomena that all the water will flow through small holes of grounds instead of saturating all of them)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't bloom the gas in the beans will bubble upwards pushing the water away from the grounds which results in channeling and uneven extraction of the particles that are trapped inside the gas bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine your grind, it's made up of particles of different sizes with most of them somewhere hovering around the size you actually wanted. So when you start pouring water without blooming the small particles will soak up the water faster than the bigger ones and will obviously start extracting earlier. In the end that will result in over extracted small particles and very under extracted bigger particles. By pre infusing the grounds you even that out a little bit. By adding just enough water to infuse all of the grounds without already extracting, you start from a more even level. The smaller particles will still extract more than the bigger ones, but the extraction levels are evened out, because the starting point is more leveled and extraction begins at the same moment for all grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why should I pour remaining water in batches anyway?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is more a matter of style. Some Baristi prefer it that way and others pour continuously. More important is that you don't brew excessively long or short. Between 2,5 min. and 3 min. is a good time (for Hario V60, different for other pour over methods). Some say that pouring in batches helps being consistent, but it's not something that's necessary. I brew very consistent (measurably with a refractometer that measures total dissolved solids or TDS) and I pour continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The special design of the spout make the flow of the liquid as &lt;em&gt;laminar&lt;/em&gt; as possible while you pour it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is our first concern, why don't coffee carafes don't have this special spout that starts from the bottom, makes a curve and ends at the top, apart from the body of the carafe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, the coffee at rest in the spout will loose so much heat and become cold rapidly. This is not what we desire. We want the coffee carafes to keep heat as stable as possible. So, we want to keep coffee all together, apiece, in one place together. That's why, coffee carafes have only one (not very nice) spout at the top. This is our first reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here comes our second one, for liquids, or in general for fluids, you have a magic number, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reynolds number&lt;/a&gt;. This number is (simply) kind of the ratio in between how particles are carried by the total motion of the coffee (inertial forces) and the resistance against being carried (viscous forces). When inertial forces are too much against viscous forces, your coffee starts to tremble by definition. This is what happens when you start to pour your coffee. Apparently, when the angle in between the carafe's spout and the vertical to the earth's gravitational vector is close to 90 degrees, Reynolds number will be bigger than when it is close to 0 degrees. This explains why emptier carafes have more laminar flow during pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the third. Fluids also have another magic number called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_number&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Weber number&lt;/a&gt;. This number explains why surface tension effects your pouring. As in the previous case, also surface tension adds an extra complexity to the flow while you pour with greater degrees. The surface tension forces your coffee to form droplets. As a result, instead of having a perfect laminar flow, you end up a turbulent and sometimes intermittent with droplets flow while you try to pour when your carafe is full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also a few other interesting concepts like Ohnesorge number and others. But I hope these could explain it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In US coffee shops, espresso costs more than drip coffee (say, $3 for espresso vs. $2.50 for drip coffee where I live). Is that because espresso is seen (in the US) as fancy? Or does it actually cost more to brew?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The primary factor is that it takes considerably more effort and skill to make an espresso than drip coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good espresso requires a far more expensive piece of machinery which requires greater upkeep and the barista needs to pay far more attention to what he is doing. The barista needs to pack the coffee correctly; pay attention to the water pressure and the resulting crema. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of grinding the coffee and putting in the correct amount of water a drip coffee does not require much work or attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you're providing espresso for your customers you need a far more expensive grinder, an expensive and finicky machine (the espresso maker) an employee who has had to undergo far more extensive training and said employee needs to be paying attention to what he is doing for each and every cup of espresso he is making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this adds to increased cost. Plus customers are willing to wait, and pay a few cents more for an espresso done right. As opposed to paying less and having an espresso in name only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Ive tried brewing espresso in a moka pot but I end up making coffee that tastes like drip coffee. Not sure why, but is it because the water level in the moka pot (I fill it up just below the opening hole) is too much?

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It is a common misconception to think that a Moka Pot can make espresso like coffee. Espresso machines use up to 9 bars of pressure to push the water through the grounds. The Moka Pot only creates around 1,5 bar of pressure (for comparison, the pressure of your tap water lies probably between 3 and 6 bar). It is simply impossible to get anything close to an espresso (although it is often considered to be the closest espresso alternative without an expensive machine supposedly due to the residue coffee in your cup that gives it a slightly similar mouthfeel and body).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can try to use very finely ground coffee, but that's about the only thing and it still won't make you an espresso. For that you need to invest in a machine. The good ones start at 500$/€. You can of course buy one for 100$/€, but they are not worth the money in my opinion. Tamping and other tweaks are not recommended because you might block the water from passing through the grounds, building up pressure until it is explosively released. If you are lucky through the pressure valve, but I've seen a Bialetti literally &quot;erupt&quot;, spraying coffee through the entire kitchen and several meters high to the ceiling (slightly more than 3m to be precise, because that's the height of the ceiling where to coffee eruption came to a forceful halt).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;To answer your question properly it is necessary to explain what coffee beans actually consist of. Around 50% of the coffee bean are carbohydrates, some of them soluble (like sucrose), but most of them are not (they add to body and mouthfeel though as non soluble substances in your cup). Other important parts are acids, such as chlorogenic acid, fatty acids, caffein obviously, proteins and other volatile flavor compounds. There are around 1000 of these volatile flavor compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the beans are roasted CO2 gas is developed and stored inside the bean. It's a natural oxidation inhibitor as it prevents oxygen from reaching the bean. When you are grinding the beans almost immediately most of the CO2 gas is exhausted. Simultaneously the surface area of the bean is exponentially increased. That means that oxygen has a much larger surface area to &quot;attack&quot; plus the gas protecting these volatile flavor compounds vanishes almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxidation starts and in 15min. around 60% of these the volatile flavor compounds are evaporated. That is why most pre ground coffee beans smell almost identical when you open the packages, independently of the bean origin. What remains as flavorful compounds are the proteins, that have mostly undergone Maillard reactions, making them rather bitter, the sucrose, caffein and some acids like chlorogenic acid. All beans (Arabica) contain those in more or less the same quantities. The flavor compounds that contribute to origin specific flavors are mostly gone by the time you open up a package of preground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus to answer your question, coffee goes stale almost immediately after grinding. The coffee in the packages you buy in the supermarket is pretty much already stale when they pack it in the factories. Hence you can probably keep an unopened package for about a year before you will note further significant impacts on the flavor, it will just keep getting more bitter as oxidation continues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffeeconfidential.org/grinding/ground-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://coffeeconfidential.org/grinding/ground-coffee/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Severini, C., Derossi, A., Ricci, I., Fiore, A.

Still, I can give a basic recipe that may help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should introduce hot air of course for bubbles and also to heat the milk up.  Make circles with the wand inside the milk. Around 70 degrees Celsius is known to be good for heating milk for bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you should stay on the surface. The wand should make some angle with the normal, so occasionally wand is in the thin surface of milk and air. There you can hear some hissing and whistling sound. Hearing the &quot;paper tearing&quot; sounds on the surface is important and told that they introduce micro bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can quickly (to not overheat) repeat these two to push the micro bubbles formed on the surface to the bottom of the jug and form new micro bubbles on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to knock the jug to a massive wooden surface to push the liquid milk to the bottom and place the foam to the top of the jug after you finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

For pour overs the difference is more significant.&#xA;However you can pre-infuse for 30s with double the amount of water as you use coffee. So for example if you use 15g of coffee you should put 30g of water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour in the water, give it a quick stir so also the grounds that swim on top get wet, wait 30s and pour in the rest of the water. A good ratio is 100ml of water for each 6g of coffee. For a cup of coffee (250g) you would then need around 15g of coffee (although I personally prefer it slightly stronger).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I have no experience with cheaper, &quot;home use&quot; refractometers but I'd assume they lack accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry coffee mass (in g): You have to weigh the ground coffee before brewing, that's all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewed coffee mass: As in 2. you will have to weigh your brew. Tar your kitchen scale with the cup on it, brew coffee and put the cup back. Voila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you just all pluck it in the equation and you are good to go. Suppose you have 15g of ground coffee, yield 190g of brewed coffee with a TDS of 1,3%, which is great for a pour over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That gives you an extracted mass of 2,47g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2,47g/15g = 0.165. So the extraction % would be 16,5%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If the level of the filled water is not above the marked safety level you can safely wait to be sure till all of the water evaporates. You can understand this easily as bubbling sounds end and you can only hear a stable hissing sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When heat is cut off prematurely some vapor may form droplets in the middle chamber and may flow back to the bottom chamber. However, it should be lightly brewed and the amount should be really small. If this is not the case, your pot may have a leak somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last option, which is not clear from your question is, whether you mention coffee solution in the bottom chamber or ground coffee particles. If you observe ground coffee particles either in the top or bottom chamber, it indicates that the grounds are too fine for a moka pot. You should ask your roastery to grind them coarser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes you can adjust the calibration of grind size of the EK43.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have the grinder plugged in and ready. Turn the adjustment knob all the way to the right. Losen the two screws on the sides of the knob slightly (turn the hexagon shaped screwdriver once). The screws are on the sides of the knob, fixing the big adjustment screw in the middle of the knob. Once they are losend you can use a flat head screwdriver or a coin to turn the screw in the middle of the know. Keep the knob totally turned to the right, to the smallest grind size setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now normally you would turn it slowly to the right while your grinder is turned on until you hear a slight rattling sound. This sound occurs when the burrs are touching. Once you hear the sound, immediately turn the screw back by about ten degrees until the sound stops and the burrs aren't touching anymore. That is the standard calibration and the only one viable for espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case you want to turn the screw further counter clockwise, so the burrs are further apart until you get the desired grind size. The maximum grind size will be coarser as well as the minimum. That also means that the grinder will not grind fine enough for espresso anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this is recommendable to do, I don't think anything can break. But I will also not guarantee it. To be sure write a mail to Mahlkönig. Also I think there are instructions in the grinder manual on how to calibrate it (to the standard espresso setting).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Both of these methods produce concentrated coffee.  However, I've noticed that my liquid yield for cold brew using the Toddy is less than half that of the moka pot, even when you take the differing strength of the concentrates into account.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put it another way: when making moka, 12oz of coffee lasts me about 12 days, whereas for Toddy cold brew, it only lasts me around 7 days.  In fact, I can get a better cold coffee yield by making moka and pouring it over ice than I can doing cold brew -- but I don't want to go that way because it's so wasteful of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize that cold brew will never have the extraction ratios of moka, but are there ways I can improve the yield for cold brew extraction, at least a little, without degrading the flavor?

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's a possibility concerning thermodynamics. Assuming that nitrogen is pressurized into the cans, it is released with a rapid drop in the pressure right after you unseal it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During this depressurization, nitrogen losses lots of energy, thus the temperature around it decreases*. Probably, the most thermally conductive thing around is the can itself as it is made out of metal**. So, the water vapor in the air condensed on the metal itself***, which remains a wet spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(*) This is the whole idea how our refrigerators work: we first pressurize a gas outside a chamber, then depressurize it to cool down an isolated chamber, which we call a refrigerator.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(**) As metals are more thermally conductive we feel heat better through them. That's why that you can move around an electric oven easily when air, which is thermally isolating, protects you. Yet, you could hardly touch a pan on top of an electric oven as metals conduct heat pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(***) That's why the condensed droplets appear outside of a beer can easily when you take it out of the refrigerator. Cold metal, good thermal conductivity, water vapor condensed on it easily.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that, my answer is just speculative as I cannot repeat the experiment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Coffee can cause some sweating when consumed in very high dosages. Your core temperature increases because of central nervous system activation and your body tries to regulate temperature. However 5 cups a day don't seem close to an overdose unless your caffeine tolerance is very low and studies have shown that normal dosages of caffeine intake don't alter core temperature or increase sweating to an extent where it would affect your hydration (see e.g. McLellan et. al 2016 for a Review). It still might be noticeable if you sweat a lot in general. I would just trial and error it by not drinking coffee for a few days. You might notice increased sweating for a day or two from withdrawal but that should pass after a couple of days. However these &quot;health&quot; websites have a lot of misinformation on them that are not scientifically supported.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;McLellan, T.

Aluminum oxidizes with a very thin layer that is hard for us to see at all and gives it a dull appearance. So I might assume that what is on there is burnt stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm checking out a local coffee shop online that was recommended to me, before deciding to go in. I noticed that the beans they sell in bins are all uncovered in photos (the photos are from Google so they're most likely taken by customers).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this normal for coffee shops to leave beans exposed to air like that? I was under the impression that air exposure directly affects flavour. The place has fantastic reviews and a few people told me about it IRL, so it seemed odd that they wouldn't follow what I would think is standard procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After careful configuration, your settings should work for both occasions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason to have a thin pellet (cake) when you fill your double basket with a single shot amount of grounds is, the area of the double basket is set to hold twice as much grounds of a single shot basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason behind that is the Darcy equation which defines the filtering properties based on&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;area &lt;em&gt;(constant in both baskets)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;viscosity &lt;em&gt;(constant for water)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;filtration velocity &lt;em&gt;(constant, if we assume you have constant pressure)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;filtration permeability &lt;em&gt;(we'll come to that later)&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and the thickness of the pellet &lt;em&gt;(we'll come to that later)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, non-constants in this equation are the thickness of your pellet and the filtration permeability. Let's consider permeability first. Kozeny&amp;amp;Carman equation defines this for porous medium. I can say, in short, reliable grind size defines this. Therefore, if you are ensured that you have homogeneously ground coffee and tamp them with equal force (say 15 kg-f), you can safely assume permeability as constant, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the last one: thickness of the pellet. Please see the below photograph I have taken, first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gro7r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gro7r.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;single and double spout portafilters&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you see, the single spout portafilter has less space and the water flows from a narrower set of holes to keep the thickness constant. When you fill the double spout portafilter, the water flows uniformly and the thickness will still be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, all you need to do is setting your grinder to single shot amount (7-9 grams). Then, using single or double portafilter according to your needs. When you need a single shot, fill your portafilter with a single shot amount of coffee. Filling your double portafilter with double the amount ends up a doppio or two espressos in two cups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Yes, there are many ways to enjoy a cup of fragrant and delicious coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Especially for the people of Aceh, drinking coffee has become part of an inseparable lifestyle. You want to taste Acehnese filtered coffee or sanger (coffee mixed milk), or espresso, everything is there.

Eggs that are used are not eggs, but chicken eggs are believed to be beneficial for health. In addition to coffee shops, this concoction is usually sold in places where traditional herbal medicine is sold on the roadside. This whipped egg mixed with coffee is said to increase vitality.

Drinking coffee can also increase stamina, or the people of Aceh often call it poding. The true coding is coffee mixed with eggs. Coffee and eggs are dishes that come from a mixture of coffee after filtering the pulp and mixing the eggs.&#xA;Although it has been mixed with eggs, the aroma of the coffee still feels, and does not smell fishy. To get rid of fishy odors, the eggs that have been shaken use a mixer and then soaked in hot water. Then given a mixture of coffee and a little sweetened condensed milk&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Both of these I think contribute to what you're seeing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;natural&quot; process can be ambiguous. You might try to search on a more specific, technical term &quot;Dry Process,&quot; usually a synonym for natural process. Here's some dry process green offerings from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sweetmarias.com/green-coffee.html?sm_process_method=81&amp;amp;sm_status=1&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sweet Maria&lt;/a&gt; for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for processing, dry process is going out of style in favor of the (technologically speaking) superior wet processing techniques. Wet process allows better removal of defects (bad seeds) and other benefits for making higher quality and more consistent product. As you note processing has impact on flavor. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a good overview of different aspects of coffee production, and roaster web sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/coffee-processing-basics&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; have overviews with their philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia and Northern Africa tend to use dry process more often than other regions, due to the dry environment conditions well suited for the dry process.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Navy coffee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No one really knows for sure. Some naval vessels used to put salt in the coffee either to kill the bitterness (or to help stay hydrated), but it was neither a universal or permanent practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Ewing, QM1(SW) USN (ret), Quartermaster E-6&lt;/strong&gt; has this to about the subject:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When navy coffee was 50% chicory, 50% cheap coffee (most of my career), it was a dying practice, based on previous coffee that was very bitter. Nowadays, the 50% chicory formula is not bitter enough to require that, and many ships get Starbucks, which they then mix with the chicory coffee to smooth the taste even more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now, for a while, Denny's had some bad coffee, and for over a year, my friends and I added salt to kill the bitterness and extra sugar to overpower the salt. Then Denny's switched blends to one not as awful, so we could drink it without salt. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Do-Navy-people-put-salt-into-their-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Do Navy people put salt into their coffee?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other sources say the complete opposite:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I had to make many, many pots of coffee as a mess crank (one who spends their first 90 days or so working on the mess decks. Think of it as KP for 90 days straight).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We used a large commercial drip coffeepot and coffee, period. No salt was added, at least I never added any. That it is strong comes from the fact that the Navy has no contracts with suppliers that have decent coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is possible that the salty taste does come from the fact that shipboard water is naturally salty. When a ship is in port, she's hooked up to local water. IIRC, ships at sea have a special desalinization process that isn't perfect, but it comes fairly close. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-91446.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;How the Real Men in the Navy Make Their Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, I used to put salt in the grounds to help remove the bitterness of the coffee. Please not that this was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; navy coffee and I was making a 100 cups at a time. No one ever complained, but that might have been to sure dumb luck too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Urban Possum has this to say about &lt;a href=&quot;http://theurbanpossum.blogspot.com/2004/11/navy-coffee.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Navy Coffee&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use an economy-brand coffee. Mother Parker's, for example, or Chase &amp;amp; Sanborn. If you have to talk in terms of roasts, these brands are a light to medium--perfectly acceptable to a majority of people. Their virtue is that they're cheap--hey, it's Navy coffee. We're talking government suppliers here.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use 2 level tablespoons for each 8-ounce cup. The standard measure for coffee is 1 level tablespoon for a 6-ounce cup. The power of Navy Coffee does not derive from the strength of the roast, but from the amount of coffee used, so as you can see, this one is stronger than most. Some old chiefs like the coffee so strong that it actually seems chewy (that comes from the tannins in the coffee and their effects on the tooth surface), but we don't need to go quite that far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt the grounds before you begin brewing. Salt, as in ordinary table salt. The measurement is a pinch, which is about 1/8th to a maximum of 1/4 teaspoon per 5 cups brewed. This is the secret to True Navy coffee: the salt will cut the initial bitterness of the coffee, but takes nothing away from the aroma. Don't worry too much about the taste, Navy coffee won't taste salty unless you use too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, the navy often employs the term a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogersfamilyco.com/index.php/the-origins-of-a-cup-of-joe/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cup of Joe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to their Navy Coffee. Where this tradition first came into use is unknown but some believe it was due to the Secretary of the US Navy, Admiral Josephus “Joe” Daniels who abolished wine (or alcohol) on Navy ships in 1914.  Thus, coffee (the next best thing) was the beverage of choice for the sailors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Now, let's check what could have been happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you have less coffee grounds so the water travels a short distance in the coffee&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you tamp lightly so water channels through the coffee instead of extracting flavors from the grounds by pressure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;your grind is too coarse, so that water could travel faster through large boulders instead of finer sandy grounds with less extraction surface&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I could suggest that you can first check your ground size, then check your tamping force (15 kg-f is more or less correct) and then the amount of ground you fill in the basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, please see these relevant discussions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2959/what-are-the-standard-espresso-parameters-dose-mass-volume-time-etc&quot;&gt;What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4346/how-to-keep-the-time-before-coffee-get-out-of-the-machine/4348#4348&quot;&gt;How to keep the time before coffee get out of the machine?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4345/how-should-i-manage-settings-for-single-shot-double-shot/4352#4352&quot;&gt;How should I manage settings for single shot / double shot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have edited an enhanced answer based on @avacado1's comments.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't have experience with subscription programs, but I have looked at such programs. I think the following points should be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshness&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a major selling point. If your deliveries are roasted over a month ago (or even less if you're doing (bi-)weekly deliveries), you lose a lot of the appeal. Why would customers bind themselves to your program if they can get as fresh to-order?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially when you're doing more frequent deliveries (biweekly or even weekly) customers will rely on your delivery. That is, if I expect a delivery on Saturday, I won't stock other fresh coffee for the days after. So if your delivery runs late, I might run out (which is exactly what your subscription program should prevent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;. It has to be reasonably good value. In particular, you don't want to spend too much on shipping, as that means customers aren't getting good value for money. Obviously, as volumes per shipment get bigger this becomes less of an issue and as your programs serves a lot of customers you might get a better deal with the delivery companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of delivery&lt;/strong&gt;. What I mean here is that the delivery should take little effort on the customer-end. For example, when I order beans they'll be delivered by someone ringing the door bell (because it's a big box), when I'm not home, they'll deliver to the neighbours or take it back. When you're sending small packages, make sure you customers don't need to be home, make sure it fits in / through the mailbox. That way, it will be there when they get home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment&lt;/strong&gt;. You probably want to offer a range of options. Some customers prefer to have a recurring payment that doesn't require them to authorise it for individual deliveries. Others like to pay per delivery or use pre-paid. Depending on payment options available in your country, you can offer a range of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The short answer is pretty obvious. Any coffee, as long as it's not decaffeinated, keeps you awake. While that is true, it is also true that some coffees have more caffein than others, some preparation methods contain more caffein than others and the ability of any coffee to keep you awake has obviously also limitations. If you are close to passing out from fatigue, than coffee also won't help that much anymore. I'm gonna break it all down quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two commercially important types of coffee beans. Arabica and Robusta. Arabica plants produce higher quality coffee with better and more complex flavors. However in terms of caffein content Robusta coffee is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#cite_note-Bunker-160&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;much higher&lt;/a&gt; with roughly twice the caffein in the brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking you could divide coffee preparation into two different groups. Espresso and everything else. Everything else has many sub groups that I'm not gonna get into too much now. The common understanding is that espresso is &quot;stronger&quot; with which is meant that it has more caffein than other coffee drinks. That is true when you measure per ml. However due to the small servings of espresso the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeescience.org/caffeine-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;caffein content&lt;/a&gt; of one shot of espresso is lower than that of a typical cup of filter coffee. An espresso shot contains roughly 53mg of caffein while a cup of drip coffee has more than twice to three times as much (115mg to 175mg) due to the bigger serving size. Turkish coffee has even higher contents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So based on this information I would recommend you to slowly drink several cups of brewed or filtered Arabica coffee during your night shifts. That should keep you caffeinated and awake more effectively than espresso plus you get to drink delicious coffee all night long. The maximum caffein content you would get with a turkish style preparation, in my opinion the best trade off between caffein and flavor would be drip coffee though. It's lighter in taste so you can drink more as well. I would recommend Arabica for the better taste and possible health benefits as compared to Robusta. You don't have to be afraid of negative health effects. Coffee is largely redeemed and is today even considered a healthy beverage with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#Health_effects&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;possible positive effects&lt;/a&gt; on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some forms of cancer, degenerative diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimers and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Coffee is an excellent countermeasure against drowsiness in general. The main and best understood mechanism of action of caffeine is that it blocks the receptors of adenosine in your brain. Adenosine is responsible for the feeling of drowsiness. It accumulates throughout the day and would act to make you feel increasingly tired. In addition caffeine likely has effects on your dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline levels. They are all chemicals  considered to be excitatory neurotransmitters. Nehlig et al. (1992) made an extensive review of the action mechanisms of caffeine. A more recent review was published by MacLellan et al. (2016).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drowsiness from oversleeping occasionally probably stems from a disruption of your cycadian rhythm. If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle before completing it, you will feel groggy and tired. Caffeine will certainly have some effect through the stimulation of your central nervous system and the increased release of stimulating neurotransmitters. But so would a morning work out or a walk in the sun. Which one is more effective for you, you will have to trial and error. I'd combine them I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chronic oversleeping however should be considered a medical issue. Hypersomnia could be a symptom for many other, more serious issues ranging from sleep apnea to depression and other neurological diseases. In these cases caffeine might have positive or negative effects. But that is a question you should ask to your physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLellan, T. M., Caldwell, J. A., &amp;amp; Lieberman, H. R. (2016). A review of caffeine’s effects on cognitive, physical and occupational performance.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can make a few assumptions based on your story. First, I clearly understand that you are also short on time. Second, as you mentioned barista style you tend to drink espresso varieties and don't check the options for disposable single-use filters, etc., which are easier to clean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;500$ budget is more than enough for a reasonable home setup. You have two options. First one is a bit more time consuming, second one is more automated. Either (1) you could buy a grinder and an home espresso machine or (2) you could buy a bean-to-cup machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you are short on time, I specifically mention what these cost in units of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a separate grinder and espresso machine, you require periodic cleaning (by cleaning tablets, I assume monthly?) and decalcifying (by tablets or liquids again, I assume monthly, bi-monthly?) for your espresso machine. The portafilter must be rinsed after each use and from time to time cleaned thoroughly. If you have a milk frother, it requires extra care after each use. Grinder also requires periodic cleaning (monthly, bi-monthly?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a bean-to-cup machine, you should require to physically clean it thoroughly in periodic intervals. This may require you to take down a few parts (don't worry, they are designed for this) and assamble afterwards. Then, of course clean and decalcify as in regular espresso machines. This option may require a bit more care, but at the end, it is way faster in daily use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, what about the brands? I think you can just read reviews anywhere. I'm happy with my bean-to-cup machine for daily coffee. Still, I know it is not preparing the best shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The washed process in coffee has a rich history that traces back to regions known for their coffee cultivation, such as Ethiopia and Central America. It emerged as a response to the need for cleaner and more consistent flavors in coffee beans. The process involves removing the pulp and mucilage from the coffee cherry before drying, resulting in a focus on the inherent flavors of the bean itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the washed process has developed and progressed through various stages of refinement. Initially, it was a relatively simple method involving pulping the cherries, fermenting them, and then washing away the residue. This helped reduce the risk of defects and inconsistencies in the beans' flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the coffee industry evolved, so did the washed process. Coffee producers began experimenting with fermentation times, water quality, and drying methods to fine-tune the flavor outcomes. The goal was to bring out unique taste profiles while maintaining the clarity and brightness associated with the washed process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different regions have also adopted variations of the washed process. For instance, in Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, the process has deep cultural roots. The Ethiopian &amp;quot;washed&amp;quot; method involves fermenting the beans in water, which gives rise to the renowned fruity and floral flavors characteristic of Ethiopian coffees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Central America, where the washed process gained prominence, variations emerged based on local practices and environmental conditions. Some producers focused on extending the fermentation period to enhance complexity, while others employed controlled fermentation tanks for precision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As specialty coffee gained momentum, the washed process took on new dimensions. &amp;quot;Honey-processed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pulped natural&amp;quot; methods emerged, combining elements of both washed and natural processes. These variations aimed to strike a balance between flavor clarity and the fruit-forward qualities associated with natural processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the washed process has evolved from a rudimentary method to a complex and versatile approach in coffee production. Its development has been influenced by the pursuit of consistent flavors, regional traditions, and the desire to showcase the unique attributes of different coffee varieties. This evolution has led to a diverse range of washed process variations that continue to captivate coffee enthusiasts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

However, if you're experiencing side effects - such as: a migraine headache, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, restlessness, frequent urination or inability to control urination, stomach upset, fast heartbeat, muscle tremors) - to consider cutting back the amount of coffee you intake. This is true not just for those that have more than 4 cups of coffee a day, but for all who drink coffee. Some people are more susceptible to coffee's effects than others, so if you feel woozy or unsteady even after two, maybe it's a good idea to cut back. If coffee is affecting your sleep schedule, also cut back.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My goodness - all sorts of new gadgets to get intrigued about - and now - you have a reason to buy BOTH sizes of acaia scales! a pearl for the base and a lunar for the pot!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for me this double weighing is to check saturation of water by beans - seems like this device could make this process reuqire fewer steps.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance - i like to make sure i'm getting at least a 2-1 water absorption relative to weight of beans. if the taste is less rich than i'd like before adjusting the amount or grind, it's a quick check to see how much water was actually absorbed by the bean - sometimes this absorption check tells me something about the age of the beans too - if they haven't degassed long enough they seem to absorp less - and that's even if the coffee slury is well stirred/no bubble in the slury.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting in an abstract kind of way to see how absorption differs fro same grind, amount but different varieties. etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's this kind of check that let me let the coffee sit a little longer after stir before doing a pour: higher absorption seems to relate nicely to richer flavour. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least that's what i'm finding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;thanks for sharing this trick new device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;m.c. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;From the video, I agree with the comment that you haven't made enough foam. This is probably mostly due to the small vessel you have. The proper steaming pitcher should hold about twice as much milk and foam as you'll actually use. This gives you the space to spin the milk and create lots of microfoam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you have an appropriate pitcher, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill the pitcher&lt;/strong&gt; to about 1/4 capacity. Submerge the steam wand into the milk and turn on the steam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stretch the milk&lt;/strong&gt; by drawing down the pitcher in small movements to create some foam. It should sound like the hissing of a cat or tearing paper. Stop making foam when the milk has risen to about 1/3 of the pitcher capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spin&lt;/strong&gt; the milk by holding the steam wand against the side of the pitcher. This should block off one of the jets so the other 2 or 3 jets are all directed towards the center of the pitcher. Try different angles until you find the right spot where the milk really spins in a fast vortex. The spinning will chop up the bubbles smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep spinning until the milk has come up to temperature. You can use a thermometer or touch your hand against the side of the pitcher; when it's too hot to touch, then it's ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smack and Swirl&lt;/strong&gt; the pitcher. Tapping the pitcher down on the table will pop any large bubbles on the surface. Swirling will loosen up the foam and allow bubbles in the middle to rise to the surface. After a few repetitions you should have a smooth glassy surface on the milk.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you're ready to pour. For this I'll defer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1uL-kvq5Fg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

First, you need to wait a while for the grounds settle down. Then, pour the non-grounded part on another cup and add warm milk. It resembles &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/217/how-do-i-use-this-indian-coffee-maker&quot;&gt;Indian coffee&lt;/a&gt;, but without sugar.

Such an electrical pot is a cool device to quickly heat up water. So, if you also place a few more cups and grab some filters you can filter your own coffee.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Cleaning is a hassle, sure. But something else to consider is the recurring cost of the coffee itself. Where I live, a bag of coffee costs almost as much as a coffee maker. Cheap coffee makers can be found for as little as $10 - $20. Small French presses are around $20 to $30. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_(unit)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A customary &quot;cup&quot; of coffee in the U.S. is usually defined as 4 fluid ounces, which is the commonly used as the measure for an amount of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you really mean just a few &quot;cups&quot; per week, then it might not be worth it to buy a coffee maker, because your bagged coffee will probably get stale before you can even use it all.

It is as easy as pods, but I get to use any coffee beans I want, without pods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Magnifica costs about $525 US, which is about as expensive as the Breville.  However, when you do the math, it is not that bad, except that it requires a larger up front investment. Plus, you do not need to buy a grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I compared to a Keurig machine which will cost around $100 US, and uses pods that cost between $0.50 or $0.90 per cup. My favorite coffee beans sell for about $12 for 2 lbs (thank you, Costco), which translates to about $0.10 per cup in the Magnifica.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I computed that the Magnifica initial and operating cost will break even with the Keurig cost in much less than a year.  No pod waste either. No coffee grounds all over my counters due to static electricity from a separate grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far, I love the machine. I get great crema and a lovely cup at the push of a button.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine has a dual block system to ensure that the manual steam wand is ready to go.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't know the exact answer of your question. However, I can say that whichever bean has more sugars, it should produce more crema.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I deduce this such that, crema is composed of three things: some irregularities in coffee (e.g. microscopic ground particles) to trigger bubble production, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to fill into the bubble, and finally some oil that's extracted from the grounds during brewing to jail the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Irregularities are common. So, this should not be the limiting case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oils... I assume most quality beans have enough of that and a proper brewing extracts them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is relevant to the Maillard reaction during roasting. As some of the organic compounds (hydrocarbons) in the bean, mostly sugars, crack down to smaller hydrocarbons and release it. The released CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is trapped within the beans' texture till you brew it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, I assume, the initial amount of hydrocarbons and correct roasting is the key factor. Note that, if you leave beans for long, the trapped CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will eventually be released so you cannot have proper crema with stale beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And about the brewing method. The crema production is, for sure, affected by the brewing method. Espresso always has more homogeneous crema as it is made by a proper machine and Turkish crema should be marbled that reflects the several phases of brewing. But, the basic bubble formation is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. Let's wait for another answer that may compare the crema characteristics of Arabica and Robusta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In my experience, if you have sanitised your equipment properly you should get three to four weeks when storing cold brew in a ready-to-drink ratio in the fridge. My feeling is that concentrate would probably have a longer shelf life, but by how much I can't really say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The taste will change over time depending on how well filtered the cold brew is. If it is only lightly strained or filtered, a lot of coffee solids will remain in the brew and make it stronger/bolder over time (sometimes it can be quite nice). If it is well filtered and clear, then the flavour will be pretty consistent until it starts to go sour or bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Such packages have a special gas discharge valve.

(Sage Express) I'm now officially an amateur barrista in the making. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I can gather, there are two important parameters in making the best possible coffee. (Well, three actually. But I'm keeping your personal choice of coffee beans out of the equation here.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First is temperature of the water. The machine takes care of that for me. Check.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next is how long it takes for the water to run through the grounded beans. This should be around 25 seconds. Your personal taste may make it a bit higher or lower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I've got the grinding of the beans, and how coarse or fine that should be. Does this affect the taste directly, or is that just one parameter combined with how hard the beans are pressed, that goes into how long the water takes to run through? Or does this by itself have a more direct effect on the taste?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can always try to experiment a bit, but would like to get a bit of insight beyond that.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Most coffee machines use magnetic water level sensors.

So, it is normal that there are not any visible parts, as it is magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wQZr.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7wQZr.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how-water-level-sensors-work&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, let's focus on your problem. These kind of levels may broke for some reason from time to time. Electrical discharge, strong magnetic field near-by, and so on. I suspect that this sensor is partly broken; it cannot correctly measure the magnetic field. If this is the case, cleaning probably will not fix your problem and you need order new parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you can do? You may try to trick the sensor with a magnet. I cannot think that it is practical if you cannot really build a working mechanism for daily use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I strongly advise coffee machines to be cleared regularly. At least, mold may grow inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="What is the most effective way of consuming coffee (and caffeine in general)?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I generally drink 1–2 cups of coffee per day, between 09:00–12:00. I switch to teas after lunch so I'm not still full of caffeine by the time I go to bed. I wouldn't say that's heavy usage by any stretch, but I can tell that coffee doesn't effect me much any more (i.e. I can have a big mug late and night and then go to bed a couple of hours later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's about the extent of how much I've thought about my coffee consumption. However, I'm sure there must be some sort of optimal strategy for getting the most ‘bang for your buck’. No articles I've found seem able to agree on one though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/the-secret-to-using-coffee-effectively-2014-2?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; says to start with a 1-month coffee fast, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitals.lifehacker.com/when-you-should-or-shouldn-t-cycle-caffeine-1742908307&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; concurs, whilst this one &lt;a href=&quot;http://moneyminiblog.com/productivity/caffeine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; says a week'll do. The first article then says to stick to one cup per week, with the occasional extra if really needed, which seems very low (since the effects only last around 6–8 hours). The second article doesn't give a target to aim for, but warns against daily coffees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalpost.com/life/food/when-are-the-best-times-in-the-day-to-drink-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/kenny-kline/how-to-boost-productivity-by-using-caffeine-like-a-biohacker.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; don't say anything negative about daily coffees, instead just saying to avoid certain times (e.g. 08:00–09:00).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/kenny-kline/how-to-boost-productivity-by-using-caffeine-like-a-biohacker.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/top-10-tricks-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-caffeine-hit-1754627885&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; both seem to advocate something along the lines of coffee microdosing, whilst the others don't really say anything on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all this conflicting  advice, is it just an fundamentally inexact science or is there a canonical guide on how to maximise coffee effectiveness out there somewhere?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More specifically,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) how long should one initially abstain to reduce any built-up tolerance? 1 week or 1 month?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) afterwards, how often should coffee be drunk in order to maximise the benefits whilst minimising the build-up of tolerance? 1 cup a day, 1 cup a week, microdosing throughout the day or something else?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I suppose I would consider optimal caffeine (primarily through coffee)&#xA;  usage to any usage that maximizes fatigue&#xA;  reduction/alertness/wakefulness whilst minimizing tolerance build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok Rumps, given that interest, let me offer a few notes-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptation: first off, our brains adapt to caffeine over time, so a dose that may give you effects now, may give you zero effects later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan to back off from caffeine every month or so if your goal is this effect rather than just the pleasure of the beverage. Why? Some receptor clean up in the brain needs to happen and that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine does not reduce fatigue - just to be clear - fatigue is a set of system level responses that tell you you are potentially under slept or under nourished  - using a drug to mask that doesn't sort that problem. What caffeine can do is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine assists &quot;alertness&quot; by again blocking what the body is telling you about rest - So, it's a kind of chicken and egg thing in terms of how it works: Caffeine will block adenosine receptors in the brain especially later in the day (when this substance builds up in the brain to start a wind down cycle) - and that's for many people about the worst time to have a coffee - because of its half life it can really start to disrupt sleep - and make it harder to get to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine also seems to be associated with helping folks work out hard, and also perform better on cognitive tests - when used as a dose in an experiment right before a test. So that may say something about &quot;strategic dosing&quot; for an acute effect (effect right at time of need), and having to work hard physically can be boosted here by the connection to serotonin - and other cool stuff happening in muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes caffeine is a long time supporter of fat burning too - so it seems to rev up fat burning - but so does green tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as I'm skeptical about some of this - the weight of evidence suggests that moderate coffee drinking has no ill effects, and while some of the benefits may be attenuated as one adapts, it's not causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A nice overview from 2010 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900710002510?via%3Dihub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't checked into more current research on each of these topics, but one review suggests that coffee compounds, when sent to a Petri dish of cancer cells, arrests proliferation of the cells - this seems like an awesome thing.&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6321559/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In working with athletes and university students - to get a performance boost, however - they cycled their dosing - really tapering off before a key event, and using it strategically in a period before the event to get the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as to your question about optimal dosing - you can test a few things for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out what your optimal cut off time is for coffee not to disturb you getting to sleep. Earlier is probably better: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most work suggests 6-8 hours before hitting the sack for sleep is needed to have caffeine flushed out of the system. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also, coffee ups stomach acids - not a good idea before going to sleep &#xA;and finally - If you don't need to push yourself awake don't do it. Figure out ways to get more rest - a challenge but after awhile if we rely on coffee to keep us upright, other things will break. So, try for a week to stop 8 hours before bed time - and after that week - play around. You might also wish to check out adding to that, reducing the amount of coffee you drink overall - but doesn't sound like a lot anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about using coffee strategically - if you're doing something creative - see if having a coffee makes a difference; if you're doing a workout - see if coffee 20-30 mins before your heavy sets makes a difference - and if it does do you need it all the time - or maybe again strategically on particular sessions only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get into the pleasure of coffee as a beverage. &#xA;Like building up a taste for dark, special really well made chocolate ups experience and reduces cravings (a little intense shot goes a long way), consider doing this with coffee. &#xA;personal story: it's gotten to a point with me that I really prefer to roll my own: I pick the beans, grind them, make my coffee and enjoy it with intent - or with colleagues who share that experience. I no longer enjoy grabbing just any coffee. This means I have one or two cups a day (or sometimes none at all) because I enjoy the real thing so much I don't spend my caffeine/coffee nickle anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So take-aways are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test it for yourself - It's not only you in one moment but learning how different contexts affect this beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider strategic dosing if that's what you're using it for&#xA;else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe explore getting into coffee as a gorgeous food that you can give yourself as a daily ritual / treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about tapering off from time to time to re-up your sensitivity and enjoy even more - without being any food that's a drug too b**ch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the best&#xA;m.c.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS - On effect on both workout intensity and on fat burning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because coffee is a food and has way more going on than caffeine, when I'm really focused on the caffeine properties around work outs (super hard training for an event) or fat burning (when already just a wee bit away from target body fat) I prefer to use caffeine pills as part of a &quot;stack&quot; for those effects - this may be way outside anything of interest, but it's just a focus/control thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;As they are two different methods of brewing, it is normal that they taste different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One very clear difference is the temperature of the water. Moka pots practically use water/steam. This let's the extraction happen in a warmer environment than recommended. Additional bitter notes of the bean is also extracted. More importantly, you loose some aromatics as they evaporate quickly. However, as you don't use a fine filter, you and up with a more bodily cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;V60 effectively filters out the body of the bean. Also, you brew in the recommended degree (around 95 degree Celcius). The result is a more finer, light, herbal-tea-like cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: I realized that you did not mention your grind size. Grounds must be grinded in different sizes for both methods. If you use the same size, it is also another reason for the difference in the taste.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;By checking if it grinds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's think about the mechanism of a grinder. Why grinders may get damaged if you adjust them when the burrs are not rotating?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A perfect coffee grinder design is a very serious engineering problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to have two very rigid burrs. When you don't have this rigidity, burrs may be damaged under high pressure of stuck coffee beans. Also, you don't want them to change their ideal shape in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want the burrs to rotate in opposite directions when they are so close to each other. The distance of the burrs must be equal at every rotational position to produce consistent ground. In practice, every grinder is a bit skewed from the ideal position. So, burrs are closer to each other at one angular position and more apart at another position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want a heat conducting material to keep the beans from burning after all the friction in between the burrs. Also, you don't want the heat deposit on the burrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The caution you've noticed is mostly relevant to the second bullet. If, by mistake, you squeeze the burrs so close to each other they may damage each other in the next run. So, they can grind each other. While the grinder is running, even if you want to, you cannot squeeze till they touch. Even if you do, you suddenly hear a loud noise to release the setting a bit. However, if the grinder stops at an (somewhat) apart position and you squeeze them to touch, you cannot notice that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it grinds consistently, probably it is OK.

But the same should apply for your Brikka.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. An electric stove is fine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you are starting with boiling water, go medium-to-low, reduce heat to a minimum once the coffee starts to rise/appear - or even turn it off, see 2. below. If you are starting with cold water (I can't be fiddling with a hot metal vessel after a short night and without sufficient caffeine in my system - see &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31514995#31514995&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34688024#34688024&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),initially go full-speed to minimize the not-so-hot water trickling through phase, then proceed as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Violent frothing may be a sign of different things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My first suspicion would be you missing the sweet spot of turning the heat down in time - or too much residual heat in your stove top. Note that electric plates are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; slower to react that gas, where you can instantly cut the heat. Learn to &quot;play&quot; your specific stove, and as an emergency measure, simply lift the Brikka off the stove.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A second issue could be the grind. While a Moka needs a finer grind than drip, a true espresso grind is too fine (and a common beginner's mistake when making &quot;stovetop espresso&quot;). In the best case, a too-fine grind will just be over-extracted and give you a lot of dregs in the cup. But the fine grid will also compact more, so that your machine will be working at a higher-than intended pressure. It may be enough to trigger the valve, but it may also be ever so slightly below the critical value, still giving you a rather forceful &quot;volcanic action&quot; (as I observed in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3356/coffee-ground-too-finely-how-to-deal-with-it&quot;&gt;this question)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If this is the case, it is an indicator that your frother have over-heated and stay in that state for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume, the heater coil switched on and off to keep the temperature stable for long. Finally, the coil burnt out itself. I don't think you can do much. Even if you change the coil, the swelled Teflon is not very healthy.

However, I can't reconcile either of these with the behavior of my moka pot:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The pot starts to sputter and gurgle as soon as the coffee starts to come up: there is never a smooth flow.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus, if I were to cut the heat at that point, there would only be a tiny amount of coffee in the pot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume I'm doing something wrong.

Bad for rats when forcefed caffeine for a week and kept awake?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise for coffee, one of the best things to do if interested in the science is look for REVIEW articles, that have been carried out over the past couple years so the latest work is included - and see where the consensus is at - &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other is to look at those reviews in terms of areas - so coffee consumption over X mg may be completely bad - for a particular effect - but completely fine in another. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now it's difficult to find where coffee at normal levels (a few cups a day) has any real problems. and may have benefits &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance - this is a quote from a 2017 big review of studies on coffee&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another review from 2017 - looking at impacts on health generally writes&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3 - 4 cups/d providing 300 - 400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. This review provides up-to-date information about coffee on health. Topics addressed include the cardiovascular system, liver diseases, and diabetes as well as gastrointestinal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you can see the consensus, when looking at a variety of areas that are related to &quot;health&quot; suggest coffee is pretty ok.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now if you want you can look into specific correlations like coffee and different types of cancer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer&lt;/a&gt;) - where intriguingly even here some work shows cancer cells in for instance collorectal cancer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/&lt;/a&gt;) are inhibited by coffee - but that's if you get really intrigued with the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps empower your coffee journey&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Main take away: if you see an ineresting news article making a claim about science - try to follow back to the original article being referenced and check out at least the abstract, and if you can the full article - in particular the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the best&#xA;-m.c.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been using a French press and emptying the grounds into the sink afterwards The main reason for doing this is that I read somewhere that coffee grounds are a good way to deter pests like cockroaches. I figured washing the used grounds down the drain would keep them from setting up shop in the sink. It only recently occurred to me that this might not be such a good idea and I wanted to know from the more experienced coffee drinkers if I should stop doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It’s not true. Any plumber will tell you that it’s best to pour nothing except liquids down the drains.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Cold-brewed coffee heats well. Hot-brewed coffee that is old (whether on the warmer for hours or allowed to cool) will have pronounced flavors that most drinkers find unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about wasting grounds, either brew smaller batches of hot-brewed coffee, or look into cold-brewed coffee. Most groceries carry pre-made cold brew or cold brew concentrate (read the labels to see if added water or milk is recommended), or consider getting a brewing container to make at home in the fridge. It stays good for 7-10 days once brewed so you can purchase or make a week's worth at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Amateur just getting started with a Breville - not happy with the results but I know I have lots to learn so I'll start with an aspect I am curious of - consistency.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's not really about consistency but more about getting the right extraction time for the coffee/water ratio. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb is to get a shot in approximately 25 seconds, with a 1:2 ratio of coffee/water. So you'd have 16g of coffee in your portafilter, to get a 32g expresso shot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's the baseline. When you achieve that, you can start experimenting with different ratios and times. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How are you grinding your beans? If you don't have a grinder you only have the dosage to play with, and it's gonna be really difficult to get to that baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

You will also have a quite different end product and have to decide for yourself whether that fits your expectation or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in any case, I recommend grinding your beans fresh just before brewing, you’ll be surprised at how much of a difference that alone will be.

For two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You’re operating the pot under pressure. Any repairs have to hold up to that and not just “hold the water in”.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Soldering and food safety are a tricky pair. You have to ensure that nothing can leach into the water that shouldn’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, you will need either experience beyond some household tinkering (which I kind of suspect you don’t have, because then you’d probably have patched it up already instead of asking here) or have to pay a professional - which considering the price of a new pot probably isn’t economical. (If this pot has a special emotional meaning, other considerations come into play, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But whatever you do, I encourage you to do some more digging into probable causes before you end up with another hole in the new pot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It depends exactly how much pressure can actually be applied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make proper espresso, you need 9 bars of pressure. To put that into perspective, that's about 131 lbs per square inch. I am guessing that there is no way the twist press can actually create that much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, you will probably end up with something similar to what AeroPress or stovetop espresso (mokka) pot makes. Not quite espresso, not quite coffee. Its somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When dealing with espresso, its not so much about the time as it is the flow of the liquid through the puck. It's about a constant water flow at the proper temperature with a consistent pressure for the duration of the extraction. I don't think there is anything in press market that will ever be able to attain that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, espresso maker typically do not use paper filters, both the shower head and porta filter basket are metal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to figure out why our coffee has been very weak despite double the amount of grounds used compared to the old coffee maker we had. We received a new coffee maker at Christmas. Both the old and new coffee makers are Mr. coffee brand. The new coffee maker however lasted a couple of months before it started producing really weak coffee. I think I figured out today that the problem is that the filtration disk needs to be replaced every month. The disk we have is the one that came with the coffee maker at Christmas a few months ago. When I look at the grounds, there are primarily two depressions where it looks like most of the water is dripping and those depressions line up with bulges in the filter above, so I think that a disk replacement should produce a more even drip. However, I am not interested in buying disks to replace every month. We already have filtered water in our house. So I’ve been wondering if there is a filtration disk replacement that can be a permanent solution to producing an even drip. Perhaps a metal or plastic piece with holes in it similar to what I see on our old coffee maker where the drips came from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried searching for such a product, but could not find one.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t attempt to dry wet &lt;em&gt;grounds&lt;/em&gt; - the quality would likely suffer and for brewing they will be made wet again, which would make the drying step moot. Just use them straight from the fridge (as discussed in your other Q/As) and proceed as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;beans&lt;/em&gt; are different. All preparations I am familiar with require the beans to be ground in one way or other. Pouring wet items in a grinder or mill designed for dry food will cause clumping, clogging and at worst damage your grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Successful drying requires two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An environment with a low relative humidity and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;good air flow around the objects that are to be dried.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So arrange your beans in a single layer on a rack or tray and find a “dry and windy” spot. The temperature can be even cool room temperature (dry surroundings and airflow are crucial, not temperatures), but may cooks prefer a low oven with the door slightly ajar. Up to 50 C won’t be a problem for the beans. Drying time depends on how wet the beans were - check on them regularly and turn them around on the tray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Minced meat (aka hamburger) is a classic example. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Instant coffee doesn’t fall into the same category of very easily spoiling food, hence the “best before”, which is a recommendation given by the manufacturer to ensure that the product is in optimal condition. After that, the quality may be somewhat decreased, but the product is usually not “unsafe”. Other examples are pasta (keeps for years if stored properly) or beans (may take longer to soften after some time, but are perfectly fine to use still).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lumps you see in your jar are caused by moisture, which made some of the granules sticky. Maybe you left it open or used a damp spoon to scoop out some instant coffee? Try to break it up gently. If there’s only very little humidity, this should be fairly easy and could already solve the issue. If not, just use the lump(s) as you would the finer granules, they will dissolve in hot water without a problem. I suggest you are a bit more careful about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/keep_one%27s_powder_dry&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;keeping your powder dry&lt;/a&gt; when handling the jar in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The quantity that ends up in the top chamber has started varying considerably. The pot is supposed to make enough for about two full cups, but sometimes only about half a cup's worth will come out and then it'll make the 'boiling over' sound that usually tells me it's done. If I try to keep it on the heat, it'll just keep furiously boiling and no more coffee will come into the top chamber. When I get a low yield, it'll always be really strong, so I can dilute it afterwards and the result is roughly the same, but it's still annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm finding it very hard to pin down the variables that make it do this. Of course I always fill the bottom chamber the same amount - just below the valve. I have been varying the grind but I will get two wildly different results even between two brews using the exact same grind setting. I have now settled on a medium fine grind. I have switched from cold water to 90°C - but again, when I was trying both of those options out I was getting varying yields for each. The only thing that I don't keep all that precise control over is quantity of beans (I roughly fill to a finger over a certain marker in my grinder) but I don't see how that would influence things that much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must admit I don't understand very well the whole percolation mechanism (in my naive brain, it shouldn't work at all!) so I find it hard to reason through it.

If you need to build more pressure, it may take longer to get to the same yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grind consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: this is related to grind size. If you have larger and smaller pieces in your ground coffee, you may get channelling. To get an idea of what happens, the smaller pieces may be lumped together needing relatively much pressure to push water through whereas the water can easily be pushed along the larger pieces. As such, an inconsistent grind can easily lead to an inconsistent brew (including yield).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tamp pressure&lt;/strong&gt;: do you tamp the grind (or do you level it out and push it with your fingers)? The more packed your grounds are, the more pressure is needed to push water through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt;, how big you set your flame and how far you set your moka pot compared to the flame will influence how pressure builds. A very large flame with the moka pot directly above it will heat quickly and build pressure faster. This might result in a faster brew. You want to watch out though, you might end up heating the upper chamber too much making the first part of your brew burn making the whole thing needlessly bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;h3&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you want a bean-to-cup brew machine, you're limiting yourself quite a bit in terms of choice. That can be a good thing as it narrows down your options. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When to bean-to-cup brew machines I'd recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/coffee/bdc650.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Breville Grind Control™&lt;/a&gt;. It's not a commercial-size machine, but with only 6 people that would probably make it needlessly expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I have no first hand experience with the machine, I recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im8jAbAc4Vo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this YouTube video, again by SCG&lt;/a&gt;, to get a good impression of the machine. Should you have machine-specific questions then I recommend asking those as a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for price, it's advertised at around 300$ on Breville's website. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for capacity, it's 60 oz (1.77L) machine. That means you can get 7 decent cups (250 mL / 8.45 oz) out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have some control on strength (in practice, more or less coffee going in) and grind size (finer or coarser grind). Furthermore, the can is insulated so your coffee keeps warm longer as opposed to machines that keep the can at a certain temperature (which eventually impacts taste).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only criterium it doesn't meet is the ability to connect it to your water line. You might be able to make it work somehow, but it's not a feature of this machine (as opposed to others which are designed to be built into a kitchen or something).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For non-Americans&lt;/strong&gt;: note that the machine is rated for 110-120 volts. It may not work in places with higher voltages and I'm not sure if there's a higher voltage version of this machine. Just something to consider before buying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer consists of three parts. The first is an on-topic advice. The second is an option to get more information to better inform you which could be used to edit / ask a new question that is more refined. The last part is more of a comment which you should take note of in a purchasing situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Advice&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without knowing any more specifics, I understand that you don't want to spend a lot of money and that brew machines worked in the past but lacked capacity. I'm going to suggest getting multiple consumer-grade-ish brew machines, possibly with some fancier options (e.g. programmable turn on and off times). Since these features are so general, I cannot recommend a specific machine, but you can easily find some based on those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Info on commercial grade&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seattle Coffee Gear has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64MQKd61GI&amp;amp;list=PLxsjzGY0Fi2SyoExt3c7L7WSNHgDKJ2rv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;playlist on YouTube dedicated to coffee makers for commercial use&lt;/a&gt;. With your description, it's hard to give good advice, but I think you can get pretty far by going through all the videos (I am not affiliated with them, I just know they make good videos).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest watching those videos to either settle on one of those options or to refine your criteria and post them here. Things you may want to specify:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price (range)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brew versus espresso-based&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Comment on cleaning and maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for cleaning, you're going to have to do some level of cleaning with any coffee machine. Can you minimise or automatise it? Yes, but never forget that it's there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that machines do sometimes break down or go out of the running because of maintenance. The best way to avoid that impacting your workflow too much would be to have multiple smaller machines (though that's not your question now).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Espresso grounds are much finer than those used in French press. French press typically has larger grounds than even drip machines so that fewer particulates sneak their way through the mesh. Since you have already purchased it, I would recommend using slightly less espresso grounds as the smaller pieces allow for the coffee to be more compressed and also allow the coffee to rest a few seconds to a minute after pressing so the grounds can settle to the bottom. Avoid completely inverting the press when pouring and there should be less “mud” at the bottom of the drinkers cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In general, you need to adjust your brewing process for each coffee individually and sometimes might even tweak and change it slightly as your coffee ages. Even if some coffees might be from the same region with the same process and similar roast, their optimal brewing process can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For filter (I assume you're using a V60 or something similar), I'd recommend the following parameters as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;97°C Water (Or boiling if your kettle doesn't have precise temperature control - the key thing is that you use the same temperature from brew to brew)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind size such that you get a total brew time of 2min 30s&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;60g of coffee per 1000g (e.g. 15g to 250g) of water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you've brewed the coffee, there is no way around using your taste to adjust the parameters. For starters, try to keep everything the same except your grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your coffee is underextracted and tastes acidic, try grinding finer so you increase extraction and extraction time. If your coffee is overextracted and tastes bitter, try grinding coarser so that you decrease the extraction and extraction time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This compass by Barista Hustle might help you find what you need to adjust to get the kind of taste you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfWZs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfWZs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barista Hustle Compass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/coffee-compass/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;updated and interactive version&lt;/a&gt; of that compass available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Simply remove any beans if you could see some and preferably rinse any coffee residue off the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you should have access from the funnel to the brewing mechanism to move the pre-ground coffee to the tamping area. There should be an upward hole somewhere. Very probably close to the mechanism, so you can see after you remove the mechanism. If it is not there, also remove the drip tray and check if you could find that hole from inside the machine. When found, you should be able to remove the beans from that hole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope all goes well and you could continue using the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(*) The mechanism should be modular for cleaning.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Sensory skills are one of the most important skills any barista and coffee lover could have. But, just like with any other skill, it takes time to develop. The first and easiest thing you can do is to drink as much coffee as you can and explore the vast world of flavor profiles and complexities of different coffees around the world have to offer. Maybe one day go find a shop selling a Yergacheve or a Genji from Ethiopia and next go find a Sumatra or Papua New Guinea. Recognizing this kind of dichotomy will help you to find major differences in coffee and eventually sharpen your palate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is, in fact, a science behind tasting coffee. It's been said in studies that when we taste things we associate them with a color. If you taste butter, you might see yellow. If you taste kale, you might see green, etc. The SCA has a great visual representation of this. You can find it on google or on their website. I would use that as guide. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, eat more food and fruits. Get more familiar with food. When you look at the color wheel, you'll probably notice a lot of flavors or fruits that you've never even heard of. Eating more food can help you train your palate for tasting coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is both a subjective and objective aspect to tasting coffee.  If you were drinking a Kenyan coffee and said, &quot;I taste green apple,&quot; then objectively speaking, you're tasting what is known as Malic Acid. If you tasted grape, tartaric acid, and so on. This does not come easily or quickly, but keep with it. Don't, out of potential discouragement, start saying you taste things just to say that you taste them. Allow your brain to adjust and sooner than later you'll be a whole lot better at being able to distinguish flavors in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Should any coffee be extracted during pre-infusion?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a Breville Express, 870XL I think, (single broiler, built in grinder). Lately during pre-infusion, a lot of coffee has been coming through before the pressure ramps up, while it's still low and in pre-infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I put the grind size very fine (a 3 or 4 on the dial) I'll get less during pre-infusion, but even less during the real extraction and also it'll be sour or whatever; you can't taste the flavour of the coffee. This happens both with the single filter and double filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had the machine for 6 months. Surprisingly the descale light has never come on, so I've never descaled it. I'm trying to keep the grounds even and I use the razor to even out the ground at the end (I blow out excess grounds dug up by the razor).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how to troublshoot this, beyond the different grind settings I tried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I am manually tamping. It looks even when i tamp and I usually tamp as hard as i can without putting my body weight into it, then I use the razor. I try to dose enough, such that after i tamp, I can use the razor to clear off a little from the top, so I know it's even.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible it's just the beans? This all started when I got new beans from a super highly rated cafe in San Fran, I think. They were already 3 weeks old when i bought them and it's been 2 weeks since then. I just didn't think it would matter for water going through pre-infusion... like how is there even enough water to go through the puck during pre-infusion, I assumed it would barely be enough to wet the puck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Using a fresh decaf bean now from Monogram and I'm having the same issue. It perplexes me that water flows through during pre-infusion and I ALSO still get espresso ranged pressure during the main extraction. Like, if water flows through with no pressure, then shouldn't it flow through faster with lots of pressure? Or instead shouldn't it be impossible to get high pressure, if water can flow through with no pressure? The physics of this whole thing confuses me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I agree with @JJJ's comment. This seems like a tamping problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I advise you to check what you've changed recently. Check whether you've changed a setting or beans. For example, if you switched from Java beans to Ethiopian Sidamo, you may experience lighter tastes. Actually, you need to set up yourself for each new set of beans. If this is not the case, please follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I understood based on the use of razor, you're trying to tamp manually. Try to keep the tamping even and use a force between 12 and 20 kgf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the machine has an automatic tamping mechanism, very probably it has a setting for that. For example, you may see tender/regular/strong coffee settings which are actually setting the tamping force of the automatic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Instead of using a spoonful of ground cardamom, consider getting cardamom pods, squeezing 2 or 3 of them to crack them a little bit and placing those in your coffee cup.  It definitely augments the taste of the coffee in the positive direction, plus you're not eating ground cardamom. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes, over- and underextracted are quite different from weak or strong coffee. The strength is determined by the amount of grounds, more grounds = stronger coffee. But that’s not what your recipe is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preparing coffee is a physical and chemical process (although some aficionados will claim that it’s an art) where soluble compounds (“flavors”) are dissolved in water. The coffee bean contains various compounds that dissolve at different speeds, with acidic flavors being quickest and bitter notes, e.g. tannins slowest. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without going into the details:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An under-extracted coffee will be acidic, and missing the “fullness” from the coffee oils.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a just right extraction, acidity will be a side note to a full body of coffee oils and sugars with a bit of bitterness for balance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An over-extracted coffee will be unpleasantly bitter, masking the desired flavors, and sometimes even with an astringent mouthfeel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beans, roast, grind size and brewing method are all parameters that influence the ratio of aromatic compounds and/or rate of extraction, but the principle described above remains. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clivecoffee.com/blogs/learn/how-coffee-extraction-works&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;clive Coffee&lt;/a&gt; has a neat blogpost on the topic and there’s even a Wikipedia article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;coffee extraction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've tasted some &quot;major&quot; flavor themes in coffee before. Chocolate, brown sugar, nuts, even fruity flavors. It's rare, though. It takes a very careful brew with just the right water and just the right brew execution. I've only ever tasted it with espresso and near-espresso (percolator, Aeropress, etc.) brews and only when literally everything about the brew process, water, and grind is close to perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things that affect coffee flavor:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maturity of beans when harvested&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Age of beans when roasted&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Time since roasting when ground&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Time since ground to brew&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistency of the grinder (i.e., few to none fines or large bits)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Water solutes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Water TDS (total dissolved solids)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Water temperature for brew&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Altitude (moreso if using a being method that requires steam)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mass of grinds used&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistency of exposure of water to grinds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Duration of exposure of water to grinds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Time from brew to consumption&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To add to this mess of complexity, there is no single value for any of these inputs that can assigned. Often, adjusting one factor can compensate for another otherwise bad factor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; need freshly roasted beans to do this. Beans can't be stale, but &quot;just roasted&quot; is not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; need an expensive grinder. Something like a Capresso Infinity can work wonderfully well, especially if you choose to use a sieve that matches your brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And even if all the material variables are spot on perfect, some stupid little thing like atmospheric pressure can muck with your perfect brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso is the most consistent way to achieve this if you have a unit with multiple thermostats and pressure regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Aeropress is easier than a cheapo espresso machine that lacks those controls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A moka pot (percolator) is easier than an Aeropress but requires a stove to use (unless you splurge on an electrical one with a thermostat and steam regulator--I don't even know if such a thing exists).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if you have bad water, sorry. There's literally nothing you can do short of filtering it and then adding minerals back in to get a good TDS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, everyone's sense of taste is different. I can name at least five ingredients in almost anything I eat by taste. Most people do not have such sensitive taste receptors. It could we'll be that most people simply can't taste those flavors in coffee no matter how it's made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Then close the hole (with some of your welding technique?) and test it again. The reason you don't want a hole is that it's harder to keep clean and can be a nice spot for bacteria or other nasty stuff to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It’s &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; coffee, which means coffee was brewed and then freeze-dried. The resulting granules can then be put in hot water to create a coffee drink (although some fundamentalist would dispute the claim that the result qualifies as “coffee”, but I digress). Think of it as the coffee-equivalent of a bullion cube. If you put that in your machine, you would - at best - get a weird result and possibly damage it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you need for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Moka&lt;/a&gt; (the kind of stovetop espresso maker you got) are &lt;strong&gt;real coffee beans&lt;/strong&gt;. Either you get whole beans plus a grinder or you buy pre-ground beans. Some will frown upon the latter, but if you are totally new, it should be ok as a start and I recommend it. Read the labels, because ground coffee comes in different grind sizes, but mainstream Italian coffee brands like Lavazza, Illy, Segafredo and the other usual suspects will for example put a little symbol on the packs showing a Moka like yours, indicating a suitable grind. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, follow the instructions that (hopefully) came with your coffee maker, e.g. fill the bottom chamber to the fill line (or just under the valve if not line is given), fill the coffee grounds chamber (the funnel-thingy) flush, but don’t compress, remove from the heat when it starts making gargling noises...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Nescafé is the same as the one-serving sachets you mentioned before, so if you are ok with that, you can still use it up when you don’t want to pull out the Moka. Although I suspect once you have come to appreciate a good coffee from fresh beans, you won’t want to go back to instant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Many places with various climates do or could produce high quality beans. Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador,  Hawaii, Jamaica, Kenya, Indonesia... the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is a fruit, a sort of cherry that can grow in wet or dry, temperate or cool climates. The climate of a location and the specific times of planting and harvest will affect the flavor of the coffee bean itself (which is the seed of the fruit).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there are other factors that affect the flavor to greater degrees. How the seeds are processed (removal of the fruit and drying of the beans) after harvest is perhaps the biggest factor. Of course roasting, staleness of beans when brewing, and brewing factors all also play significant roles in the final taste of drinkable coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's close to impossible to control for all these factors. Specialty coffees can typically each be sourced to a single farm and a single harvest because that's the only way to ensure consistent processing of the beans. But even then, logistics of sourcing present challenges to consistently roasting and brewing those beans. And changing climates across the globe will challenge preconceived notions of &quot;where the best coffee comes from&quot; as we move into a bleak future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I can’t give you an answer based on tasting the authentic product, but:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The various “brown” or “raw” sugars are characterized by the molasses content, which is part of the original cane sugar juices. This juice has a characteristic flavor profile with notes reminiscent of caramel and malt. In the production of white sugar, they are filtered out, leaving behind the white “just sweet” sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The darker (and sometimes “wetter”) a brown sugar is, the higher the molasses content and the more extra flavor components are in the sugar. In cooking and baking, brown sugars are often used not just as sweetener, but also for the flavor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The logical conclusion regarding your question is: If brown sugars are used in not-just-minute amounts, they will be noticeable. So the flavor of the Cuban coffee will and should be different from espresso with white/refined sugar. How intense the brown sugar flavor is, depends on how much sugar is used per serving and how dark it is. The term “natural brown sugar” in your source suggests a rather intense flavor, which should be quite similar to jaggery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think that’s feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you roast coffee beans, the beans undergo chemical changes that create the desirable flavor components.

If (whole!) beans you bought are not roasted enough for your liking, you can try to re-roast, although the results may not be exactly what you were aiming for. Theoretically possible nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for instant coffee you need to remember that instant coffee is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; finely-ground coffee beans, but &lt;em&gt;prepared (=brewed and filtered)&lt;/em&gt; coffee that has been freeze-dried, clumps up into small granules and can be reconstituted by adding water. The beans that are changed in the regular roasting process simply aren’t there in instant coffee, which is why you won’t be able to develop the desired flavors by roasting instant coffee. You may be able to create some burnt flavors, but I don’t think that’s what you want. You should also note that the instant coffee granules are not very stable and likely to break up and, depending on your home-roasting method and tools, may clog up and damage your equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;So, it's kind of complicated. To understand why the hole area is important, we need to consider how an espresso is made and what it takes to taste good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;When does coffee taste good?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making coffee is the processes of extracting water solvable compounds from the coffee grounds. Some taste good, some don't. The trick is to extract the right amount of each. You can control this by how much and how long the water touches the coffee grounds. Too much water and bitter, nasty compounds are extracted. Too short and only sour and volatile compounds end up in the water. You want the right balance for that delicious espresso you have come to love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Setting up the ideal coffee puck&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso is about extracting coffee flavors from the small coffee particles. We want to extract each particle exactly as much. To do so, you carefully grind the particles to a certain size. The reason why people buy expensive burr grinders is to make the particle size distribution as narrow as possible (so all coffee grounds have the same size, so water touches the same surface area). You tamp the coffee in the filter basket as level as possible. Ideally, all particles are the same size and the density of coffee is homogeneous in the whole coffee puck (achieved by proper distribution and tamping level). Then water is pressed trough the puck at 9 bars of pressure. Ignoring the filter basket, the flow rate trough the puck will be the same everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;It's about flow rate&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The water will take the path of least resistance (lowest density, largest holes). So if you've carefully set up your puck to have a perfect particle distribution and homogeneous density but the holes in your filterbasket vary in size, more water will flow trough the larger holes. More water passes trough that path and the coffee above, therefore extracting those parts of the coffee puck more. This is an uneven extraction and deviates from the ideal where every particle is extracted exactly as much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get a homogeneous water resistance, we try to give the holes the same surface area. This ensures that if you have the perfect puck, water will flow evenly throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I bought my Strada basket, &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9T0Q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;it came with a histogram showing the hole size distribution&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is pretty cool. You can see how narrow that Gaussian is, and it was a noticable improvement from the filter baskets that came with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The question is about &quot;safe to consume&quot;, with the side topic of being &quot;good flavor&quot;.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, Coffee has a shelf-life about 3-9 months, depending on if its ground, whole, flavored, and how and where its stored.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That may spark some arguments though, but the question is about &quot;safe to consume&quot; not flavor.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;At a store, they would not have a bag of coffee on the shelf for more than 1 month from roasting, regardless of how its sealed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Looking at food vacuum seal places, they say that coffee sealed will last up to 3 years vacuum sealed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://handykitchenaid.com/food-expiration-vacuum-sealed-food-shelf-life-chart/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Link 1 to vacuum bag shelf-life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foodvacbags.com/pages/storage-time-for-foodvacbags-vacuum-sealed-foods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Link 2 to vacuum bag shelf-life&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eatbydate.com/drinks/coffee-tea-shelf-life/coffee-shelf-life-expiration-date/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; specifically about coffee and has a chart and table for that.&#xA;This is right in line with the other articles and what I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are all recommendations, and there is good reason.  Usually with any vacuum seal there is some oxygen that gets into the product and that will cause it to degrade over time.  The oxygen is part of the air, which may also contain some moisture.  The moisture will also degrade the product over time, creating an environment for bacteria to grow in.  Bacteria needs oxygen and moisture to grow, and the reduced oxygen slows down the process of spoilage and creates an environment to limit the growth, while also limiting the evaporation of any moisture in the food (thus it retaining its flavor).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Also, the vacuum seal can and will degrade over time itself eventually letting in some oxygen and moisture.  This is different depending on the packaging and type of seal.  This is based on the manufacturer of the vacuum seal as well, though some are better than other, often the manufacturer will put a date/time on the seal knowing it will last longer than that but that is the less than minimum, so that way its not an issue when the seal does give.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically, when coffee goes bad there could be some mold &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; its exposed to moisture for a long period of time, but usually it would just lose its flavor and possibly some of the caffeine.  You can tell if its gone bad by the smell when you open it.  If when you opened it, and it smells of mildew or mold, then its definable bad, and that would be bad to drink.  If its just odorless and bland smell, then it is probably still good to drink, but probably won't have any flavor.  Coffee like that, will not be harmful to you, just not be &quot;good&quot; to taste (but also probably not &quot;bad to taste either).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Though I did find some very fine lint type things inside. If you ask me it looks like the ends of a dandelion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That could have been some of the beans breaking down, or just a bean that got crunched in the packaging a while ago.  Depends on the coloration and smell and such.  Personally, I would try that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you already brewed it and didn't find any bad taste, smell or feeling from drinking it, then its probably good.  Additionally, you could also blend this coffee with other fresh coffee, assuming its still &quot;good&quot; based on the above.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coffeebrewguides.com/does-coffee-go-bad/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article and this gives more details on it going &quot;bad&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been watching videos of people preparing coffee in Moka pots on Youtube and one thing I noticed is that most people seem to initially leave the lid open. However, when I tried this the initial volume of water from the spout erupts out in both directions with such ferocity that it actually leaves the pot entirely and drenches the stove on either direction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In every video I have seen they seem to have a nice gentle flow that merely dribbles out of the spout and falls down the spout into the chamber. My one is more like a volcano!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried using a lower setting on the hob - there are 6 settings. At the very lowest (#1) it doesn't boil at all. At settings 3-6 I get a huge jet of water as described above. At setting #2 I get a smaller jet of water (that still shoots out of the pot) however on this setting the water seems to stop boiling up from the lower chamber leaving me with half a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realise that I can just do this with the lid down but I'm curious as to why this seems to happen. It's a single cup aluminium Moka pot which hadn't been used regularly for maybe a year until the last few weeks when I have been using it regularly. I took it apart earlier today and gave everything a good scrub. Still no difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried with the coffee chamber, full, half-full and empty (so just boiling water). It doesn't matter - same result with all.

It does, however ensure you put fresh water in there for each brew as opposed to letting the water sit in the reservoir going stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you like larger servings, make sure your machine supports more than just the usual 12 ounces per brew; many machines offer 12 ounces as the &quot;large&quot; serving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want your brew made for you automatically at a specified time (waking up to a fresh cup of coffee is certainly a plus in the morning), your expenses will start going up for machines with clocks and timers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If refilling the single-serving water reservoir becomes a chore due to increased coffee consumption, get a model that has a larger reservoir, so the only thing you have to attend to is the capsule. The machine will tell you when it needs the water tank refilled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some machines add more bells and whistles such as a milk frother; if those extra features and accessories appeal to you, you are looking at spending in the three digit price range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend getting a machine that can make both capsule-based and ground coffee. This will provide more flavor options as not every coffee is sold in capsule form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as quality is concerned, the aforementioned cheap single-cup machines tend to be made from cheap plastic parts and they may start malfunctioning sooner. The lid mechanisms are the first ones to go (moving parts usually are), and if you have a dual-purpose machine, the cheap plastic filter may start to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not neglect to change the water filter in the reservoir at the manufacturer recommended intervals.&#xA;To answer the other part of your question, with the same amount of water and the same capsule, you will be hard pressed to notice any differences in taste when going up in price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

That way, when you're pressing down the strainer is already near the bottom of your container meaning you cannot press much further. To solve this, try using a container of an appropriate size. If your French press is filled at least halfway at step 4 then this shouldn't be an issue, if it's much less, consider making a larger batch or using a smaller French press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Blooming&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/348/6506&quot;&gt;Blooming&lt;/a&gt; is technique for letting gasses (mainly carbon dioxide) escape the coffee beans.

But you should be aware of nasty things growing in your water, like salmonella. At the cafe I worked at they left the machine on overnight to combat this. For your situation; I'm not sure. Maybe you're risking scale buildup, rust and general stale water. I'd definitely at least flush the boiler when you power it up again, no one likes the taste of stale water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are two important factors here: &lt;strong&gt;temperature&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;control&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Temperature&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature is probably the most important factor here. You don't want the temperature to be too low, when that's the case you won't be able to extract all that you want. You can easily ensure you're not using water that's too cold, either by pouring straight from the kettle (goose-neck or otherwise) or by preheating the pouring vessel (e.g. your pouring cup).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Control&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Control is important for pour over brews, but it's not absolutely necessary. You can simply use a regular kettle to pour but you'll have less control over the flow rate (how fast water flows out) and where you irrigate the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's definitely possible to use a (pouring) cup instead of a goose-neck kettle, just make sure it's pre-heated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I suppose this depends on your machine, but it is easily tested. The water should be hottest while dripping, but while it passes the filter, it'll cool down, so at what temperature it lands in the pot can only be measured, or tasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of temperature, letting coffee sit after brewing is never recommended since it changes flavor (and not for the better).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The clear answer: It depends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, not all fully automatic models are constructed in the same way. Which also means the required effort varies between brands and models. Some are pretty self-cleaning, others less so. Checking consumer reviews on the usual shopping websites should give you a first idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, regular cleanup is non-negotiable. If you skip daily cleaning, your machine will become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. If you doubt that, simply open the machine in an average office where everyone pulls a shot, but nobody bothers to do more than dump out the used grounds every now and then. Especially the brewing part and various pipes can turn you into a tea drinker at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course a two- or three-part setup of grinder, espresso machine and maybe frother must also be cleaned, but apart from the parts touching the milk, you deep-clean far less often (e.g. dismantling the grinder) or a quick rinse or wipe will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you have to find your personal threshold for the covenience vs. effort question. The answer will depend on the machine model, but also on the kind of use the machine gets. For our household where we pull between (usually) two and (rarely) eight shots a day and only occasionally steam milk, we purposely picked separate items, but that was also based on counter space and kitchen layout and the charm and flexibility of “handmade” coffee&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. My parents decided that for about the same parameters an all-in-one machine was the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;————&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; We used to quite happily work with a Mokka before buying an espresso machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This will happen if you are using flavored coffee, if you're using too much water relative to coffee, or if your grind size is too large.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flavored coffee causes this because a big portion of the &quot;coffee grounds&quot; are actually flavoring solids that dissolve in water. When you add water, those solids dissolve, and you're left with not enough coffee to hold back the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Too much water relative to coffee can cause this simply because of gravity. More water means more force pushing down on the coffee beans, and that means more water can get through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind size too large is a likely cause. Your coffee simply might not be creating a cohesive barrier to water. Coarsely ground coffee will do this because the coarse grinds leave little gaps where the irregularly shaped grinds touch. Water can flow through those gaps. For Aeropress, you want a grind setting between drip and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

A better measure is brew ratio, which describes the water to coffee ratio in mass units. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://handground.com/grind/66-recipes-for-amazing-aeropress-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;handground.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are a lot of recipes for AeroPress with brew ratios ranging from 17:1 at the weakest up to 8:1 at the strongest. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest starting somewhere in the middle and adjusting based on the results. Since you're already getting a weak cup, the next step should have a slightly lower brew ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can either switch to mass units (grams or Imperial units with a simple kitchen scale work fine). The benefits of weight units are twofold:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're more precise. Most kitchen scales are accurate to the gram or even a tenth of a gram. With scoops, you may need to use something like &lt;em&gt;a little bit less than a full scoop&lt;/em&gt; and you'll have difficulty reproducing that exactly, even more so when you want to adjust a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units translate to different coffees as well. Suppose you have a coffee with a different roast level, then its density may also vary. As such, a volumetric scoop of one coffee contain more or less coffee than a different variety of coffee. This is more of a factor when working with whole beans, but if you buy pre-ground the grind size will also have an impact when using volumetric scoops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'd suggest switching to mass units and keeping track of adjustments and taste. If you don't like to get into the whole ratio thing, you can just fix the water content and increase the amount of coffee to get a stronger cup. The only time when you need to change the amount of water is when you want to adjust how much liquid you get in your final cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Also, there seems to be a kind of mismatch between the settings on the machine itself and what I am reading online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The double basket takes 15 - 18g of coffee, but the double shot button pushes through 60ml of water for a ratio of 1:4 or just under. You can control extraction manually but that seems weird.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve read I want 1:2 or just under if I’m making a flat white, so I have been going for 35g of espresso out of 17.5g of coffee in around 26s, not counting pre-infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get somewhere around those numbers, I have to be on the second finest setting (this is with beans that were roasted in the last 3 weeks) and the needle on the pressure gauge goes beyond the “espresso range” marked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This all seems pretty bizarre – the shot is nothing out of the ordinary but the settings are at the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shots I am getting still taste under-extracted to me. If I go a step finer my extraction time goes way way up, so I also have to reduce the amount of coffee.&#xA;Is that the way to go, or should I keep the grind the same and run more water through?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking the fact that everything is at the extreme (portafilter packed as full as it will go, grind setting more or less as fine as it will go, pressure out of range) should tell me something, but what? Just that they built the machine around a ratio of around 1:4? I don't understand why they would do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried changing the beans btw – it didn’t really make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a Sage with a built-in grinder as well. The grinder isn't great, it has some inconsistency that may clog part of your filter basket just enough to reduce the flow a bit more than you'll like. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've solved this by adding a wet paper filter before adding the coffee. For this I use paper filters meant for AeroPress, which are only slightly too big for my portafilter (like 2 millimeters too large in diameter). My technique is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push some water through the filter basket to warm it up a bit, then dry with a paper towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a pre-wetted paperfilter to the bottom of the portafilter, press it down with your fingers. It's okay if the sides of the paper filter go up a little bit against the wall of the portafilter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add your ground coffee as you normally do and tamp. Then pull the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, this allows me to push a bit more water through compared to keeping everything the same without the paper filter. My theory is that it keeps the holes in the filter basket nice and clear so the water gets pushed through more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seeing that this is a pretty cheap option, I'd give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Therefore, it is expected that they optimize for profit most of the time, not for the taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One cost-saving approach is to have lots of beans, roasting them all together right after the harvest --when the beans are easily available, then pack them and send to many other selling points --sometimes overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result, it might be expected that shipping numerous of containers of packed beans overseas may take a while. However, we cannot just estimate this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One note, checking the packaging date may help you do a closer estimation. I'm not aware of the legislation around the globe, but when I check a bag of beans in the nearby store, every time till now, the typed date is enough for me to throw the bag as far away as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case the question is relevant to the coffee beverage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The well-known recipe for the ground coffee to coffee beverage ratio is around 1:20.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One pound is equivalent of 453.6 grams. Therefore; you may expect to have 9072 grams of brewed beverage. When you assume that a cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; coffee beverage is around 1 grams, yo should have a bit more than 9 liters of beverage. Again, this makes around 320 oz. beverage. If you assume that your cups are 10 oz, &lt;strong&gt;you should end up with 32 cups of beverage from 1 pound of ground coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I admit that, using such a unit system makes it way harder than stating &quot;1 kg coffee ends up two hundred 100 ml cups&quot;, at once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case the question is relevant to the density of coffee:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Updated after Paul's comment)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution is simpler as it depends solely on the density of coffee. Still, we may require a series of unit conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The density of ground coffee is around 0.32 gr/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This means, 453.6 grams (one pound) of coffee has a volume around 1.42 l. This volume is roughly 50 oz. Finally, a cup is 8 to 12 oz, let's say 10 oz on average. Therefore, a pound of coffee should be more or less 5 cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This density is for ground beans. Green coffee beans has a density around 0.56 gr/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Based on your comment on the question, you are referring to compacting ground coffee in the portafilter. This process is referred to as &lt;code&gt;tamping&lt;/code&gt; when making espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The widely-accepted amount of downward force to use when tamping a standard double shot of espresso is 30 lbs. You can view a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;source here&lt;/a&gt; but if you simply do a google search for &quot;espresso tamping pressure&quot; you will see 30 lbs mentioned ubiquitously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using a tamper directly on the coffee grinds, it is easy to practice putting down 30 lbs of force by practicing on a scale. If you are indeed using a &lt;strong&gt;lever&lt;/strong&gt; to do the tamping, I suggest reading the instructions that came with your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;30 lbs of force on the lever may not result in 30 lbs of force on the espresso, depending on the setup of your machine. The lever may even be engineered specifically to stop tamping at 30 lbs. Tamping espresso with a lever setup can be a bit of controversial thing in the coffee world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever your setup, you want 30 lbs of downward force to result from whatever it is that contacts with the ground coffee and tamps it down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Putting too much force on the ground coffee is called over-tamping. The coffee grinds can become over-compacted which can slow down extraction (lead to over-extraction) of the espresso, lead to channeling (where water finds inconsistencies in the grind and channels through in small spots, leading to unequal extraction in the espresso puck), or even block it completely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you used 1 ton of downward force when tamping, I suggest that you will likely break your portafilter and its basket, along with whatever is beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I bring water to a boil and then pour into the press to preheat the press. I grind my beans and I prefer dark roast. Then I dump out the water in the press and add the ground coffee. I use ratio of 16:1 (16 grams of water for each 1 gram of coffee, so as an example in my 2 cup press I grind 17 grams of beans and pour 272 grams of water. I usually pour 1/2 the water and then stir to bloom using a wooden chopstick (no metal to avoid breaking glass press). Then add balance of water. Cover the press with the screen and then wrap the press using a dish towel to insulate and keep temp up. 4 mins to brew and you have a great cup of Joe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: My opinion is not to get too crazy with what if my temp is off by a degree or so or if I have a gram of coffee or water more or less than target. If you brew it and it tastes good to you that's what counts. If you taste and it seems too strong for your taste just add a bit more hot water to your cup. I never come out with a too weak brew.

The roots are sturdy, so you’ll need a sharp knife, especially since the pieces shouldn’t be longer than 1 inch. If you don’t cut them in the same size, there’s a chance that they will not roast evenly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roast the chicory pieces. Arrange them on a shallow baking pan or a baking sheet and place them into the oven. Toast them at 350 degrees until their color changes to golden brown. If you can sense a coffee-like smell, this means they are finished.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind the roots. Place the roasted chicory roots into your burr grinder and grind them with the same coarseness as you grind your coffee beans. Ideally, it should be a fine grind if you’ll brew them in an espresso machine or a coarser grind if you have a French press, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mix chicory with ground coffee. The ratio is up to you. If you want the taste of coffee without the caffeine stimulation, you can try with a 4:1 ratio of chicory to coffee. Sometimes a 2:3 chicory-to-coffee blend of is good if you want to gradually reduce your caffeine intake. If you want to spread out your coffee supply over a longer period, adding four-fifths of chicory would be enough. Alternatively, you don’t have to add coffee at all for a true chicory coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind the roots. Place the roasted chicory roots into your burr grinder and grind them wit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brew your coffee. Use the chicory and coffee powder mix to make the coffee as you regularly would. All the other factors such as time or technique should be the same.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add some foamed milk, toppings, or flavorings to enhance the aroma and serve your chicory root coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically you roast the chicory in the oven at 350°F (or 177°C) until they turn brown and after cooling them you mix 20-40% of their grounds with coffee grounds. Mixing chicory in doesn't really yield gourmet coffee so imprecise recipes are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been brewing an Ethiopian bean recently on the Fellow Stagg Pour Over, and experienced something interesting. When brewing fresh at home, the coffee has delicious fruit notes. However, I brewed it once and took it in a travel mug to work, while it had the same qualities, the fruitiness tasted stale, and more like &quot;old fruit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if this is due to the coffee degrading due to travel, or if it has oxidized by the leftover airspace in the cup (note: this particular cup has an air-tight seal for a lid). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, my question is, does coffee oxidize while traveling, and does the amount of headspace you leave in your travel mug affect how well the coffee travels? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[EDIT]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe this question has already been answered &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/367/chemically-whats-happening-to-coffee-after-its-brewed&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you mean the products you see at a grocer, the answer is simply grind. &quot;Turkish coffee&quot; is a finer grind setting than espresso, so that the final product very closely resembles dust. &quot;Italian coffee&quot; is likely either espresso ground to be used with an espresso machine or literally &quot;imported from Italy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turkish coffee is for use with a special, Turkish brewing process. The coffee dust is mixed with water in a special pot called a cezve or an ibrik. The solution is brought to a boil. Then the coffee is scooped or poured from the pot. Turkish coffee is drunk unfiltered, so you drink the actual coffee like you would with cocoa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso is brewed by forcing water through coffee grounds at pressure. The pressure extracts oils and compounds from the coffee to create the famous Italian coffee called espresso. The grounds have to be relatively course compared to Turkish to support this process; too fine grinds in an espresso machine would clog the machine. Espresso is partially filtered, meaning you don't drink most of the actual coffee grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

There is a page on petmd.com titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.petmd.com/dog/emergency/poisoning-toxicity/caffeine-and-pets-safety-tips-and-considerations&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Caffeine and Pets: Safety Tips and Considerations&lt;/a&gt; which states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It turns out our pets react in much the same way we do. Caffeine makes them restless. They get jittery and their hearts start to race.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't sound.... ideal! It turns out that it's not, and the next part of the page makes it pretty clear why:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But because our pets weigh so much less than we do, it only takes a relatively small amount of caffeine to cause a big problem, potentially leading to expensive hospitalization or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further on in the article it's explained that 23-27mg caffeine per lb of body weight can lead to cardio-toxicity. For a 3.5kg cat, such as mine, that equates to between 177mg and 207mg of caffeine. Based on the table in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1538/1587&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;, that puts a double espresso or a 200mg caffeine tablet squarely in that range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's absolutely not to say that giving your dog, or other pet, coffee (even decaf!) is something you should consider doing. The petmd page states it much better than I ever could (my emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Cats and dogs should not ingest any caffeine,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Dr. Elisa Mazzaferro, adjunct associate clinical professor of emergency-critical care at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;"/>

I don't like canned sardines so I didn't stock up on that as I would never eat them unless I was under duress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the thought went to coffee. I buy my coffee from a local roaster with a store a few blocks from where I live. As a result I don't buy a lot of coffee at one time.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Water is complex in terms of coffee, and the answer is &quot;it depends&quot; in terms of how it will affect your coffee. Every coffee roaster tastes their coffee with a certain water, and it's likely the coffee tastes best with the water it was roasted against. You might experience the opposite problem from what you described with some roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple things you'll want to account for. There are many undesirable flavors you can get from heavy metals, or chlorine-tasting water (so at a minimum you want your water to taste good). Beyond that, you really care about the amount of Calcium, Magnesium, and buffer (generally HCO3) in your water. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on what you said of your water, I suspect you have quite a bit more bi-carbonate hardness (HCO3 or buffer) in your water. This kind of hardness will rip out the acids in the coffee very well, but will also push the pH level of the final cup to a balanced state. Your friend's water likely lacks enough to bring the coffee's pH to a balanced state where it's enjoyable (fun hack, add ~2g/L of baking soda to water, a source of bi-carbonate, and add this in increments to the final coffee, you can fix the acidity!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calcium and Magnesium also work together to bring out acids and other taste-y bits to your coffee. Calcium + Bi-carbonate is why your kettle is scaling quickly. You can filter your water (a cheap Brita filter will remove Ca and Mg from your water). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally mix my water up from distilled for brewing to a specific ppm of Ca, Mg, and Bi-carbonate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can increase your total hardness of water if you get a better system by simply adding baking soda to the water, or other mineral salts. I would be careful about this however and ensure you are still creating something that is safe to drink. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want measure your water, you can use various titration kits to quantify your house water. If you want to do more research on water and coffee, &lt;a href=&quot;https://eustore.sca.coffee/products/book-water-for-coffee?_pos=15&amp;amp;_sid=a35b576e2&amp;amp;_ss=r&amp;amp;variant=5081224388&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the popular book on it.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;No. Unroasted coffee beans are denser and wetter than roasted beans and will not grind well. You will break your grinder trying, and even if the grinder succeeded, you'd get more of a mush than solid grinds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, roasting ground green coffee would allow much more of the oils and gasses trapped in the coffee to leak out during roasting than even the driest roast. The resulting coffee would taste strange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The reason this is suggested is because beans essentially lose flavor over time. They go stale and their oils go rancid. Grinding finer exposes more surface area of the bean to the brew and helps you eke out a bit more flavor when the bean is old and stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, doing this for pour over can backfire as pour over is highly sensitive to grind. Too fine and your pour over won't drain; the filter will clog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try it first with your normal grind, and if that's no good, dial it one or two clicks finer. Much past that and you're in no go territory for the brew method most likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It produces a crema, but I suspect that this is artificial from aeration, similar to how some of the cheaper espresso basket systems have an actual aerator in the basket to produce the appearance of a crema.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had a similar reaction to this type of coffee preparation method?

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The appeal of espresso is the ability to extract, using high pressure, lots of oil within the coffee itself. That isn't easily achieved with any other type of machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for low pressure you can have filtered (anything with paper in between you and the beans), unfiltered (without paper), poured (think drip filter) and full immersion (french press).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The senseo is using a paper filter, removing more oils from the coffee than without a filter and not allowing any &quot;fines&quot; very small coffee particles into the cup. It uses only moderate pressure and it is extracting rather fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So these are the variables that seem to create a smooth cup for you. I suggest looking up (or trying) what different extraction durations do to the taste, as well as what the grind size and filter will achieve, both things taht could fill pages ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Not milk but full fat coffee cream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This dilutes your coffee a little bit, and suppresses any sour or overly bitter notes. Personally I like it even better than coffee without it because you get the softer coffee flavours that might usually be over powered in a standard coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would also ask why the caffeine is important to you? Regular consumption doesn't improve one's concentration as the body normalises to it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would consult your doctor and seek their advice.

It makes sense that you'd get a sweeter more balanced cup when the coffee doesn't choke. To me it also makes sense that you have a greater chance of it choking with more beans. Not sure how it could un-choke by itself, one theory is that once enough water pressure is present it creates a low-resistance channel where water flows through very quickly (and this water doesn't extract much coffee, rather would mostly dilute in this case).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I would say yes. If you would increase the &lt;strong&gt;grounds : water&lt;/strong&gt; then more caffeine would dissolve in the water. Caffeine is an extremely soluble compound; however, more caffeine does not mean a &quot;better&quot; test. It could become unpleasantly bitter. Cup A will have more caffeine than B. let's say you use &lt;strong&gt;1/2 the water&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Cup A&lt;/strong&gt; compared to &lt;strong&gt;Cup B&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cup B&lt;/strong&gt; will have close to &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; the caffeine &lt;strong&gt;saturation&lt;/strong&gt; than A; however, the &lt;strong&gt;sum total&lt;/strong&gt; caffeine will remain the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt;, .

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Short answer: &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By reheating your kettle between pours you introduce another variable which can mess with the consistency of your brew. The reason we measure everything when brewing coffee is to be able to isolate a single variable, adjust it, and determine its impact on the taste of the brew. Consistency is the most important thing here.&#xA;Losing one or two degrees in your kettle while brewing shouldn't have much of an impact on the taste of your brew if it happens consistently. Also, the water drops in temperature significantly when it reaches the grounds, as explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_r5kpXPRYo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;James's video&lt;/a&gt; you probably meant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both James Hoffmann and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B02U5ZqJhM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Matt Perger&lt;/a&gt; recommend using boiling water for brewing because seeing water bubble (and therefore knowing it's exactly 100°C) is more reliable than having a thermometer telling you the temperature. &amp;quot;25 degree water looks exactly the same as 85 degree water&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to let the water come to a boil and as soon as it starts boiling, start your brew and don't reheat it between pours. Even though the water might cool down a little, it will do so similarly from brew to brew. If you reheat your kettle between pours, you'll have to put in on the stove the exact same way each time, which is difficult (maybe not difficult but surely finicky) to achieve, especially if you have a pour-over to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, before anyone comments with &amp;quot;100°C is too hot, you'll burn the coffee&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is roasted at temperatures around and above 200°C, you're not burning anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It will taste burnt and bitter because the bitter compounds will be extracted more easily.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that case, over-extraction is your problem which can easily be solved by adjusting your grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This is a catchy question. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By tradition, all pumps have a pressure gauge at the end. So, tradition it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wonder why it is a common place to put a pressure gauge; the reason is if you don't monitor and control the pressure at the pump end the results could be catastrophic. Imagine that something blocks the output of the pump and you didn't monitor it. The pump will try to push the block with all its might. So, the pressure will rise up to the maximum and very probably, the whole set up will blow up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you see that there is a pressure release valve on the chart (Looks like a simplified P&amp;amp;ID). When the gauge reads above normal, this valve protects the device from excess pressure by releasing out the steam to the atmosphere. So, now we have a safe pump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, why the pressure gauge is not connected to the boiler? Actually, if you check the P&amp;amp;ID, you see a straight line from the pump end to the boiler top. No valve exists there. So, the pressure at the pump end and boiler top are equal as they all share the same volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are right that the boiler has a warming chamber and its pressure may be different than the boiler top. I think, as there are not valves exist in between the boiler top, warming chamber and the boiler bottom, the designers think that the steady state pressure will be even among these three volumes. Even though the pressure at the warming chamber could be a bit above than the other parts, this should be temporary and the warming chamber is made from a though material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to mention one more thing. The flow goes from higher pressure to lower pressure. Saying in reverse, to make the steam flow, the pressure at the pump end should be slightly higher than the boiler top. So, the gauge should deviate slightly from its steady position temporarily when the pump is in action. You may try to observe this to validate my reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; Sorry, I mentioned that the pressure release valve releases some steam to the atmosphere. I assume, the reservoir has atmosphere pressure. The released steam will probably get mixed with the liquid water in the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Is the moka pot predisposed to producing burnt or bitter coffee?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I bought a moka pot in the hope of producing coffee that more closely resembled espresso. And using good coffee, and experimenting with technique, I have produced some very rich, nicely-balanced extractions. However, I have been able to reduce, but never fully remove, some underlying burnt notes in the coffee produced. This problem has led me to ask myself about the nature of the moka pot design itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water in the chamber is heated and the vapour inside trapped. Once the vapour pressure in the chamber is great enough, it forces the heated water up the spout, through the coffee charge, and into the collection chamber. My experience has led me to ask: is the heat required to produce adequate vapour pressure is not inherently higher than the ideal, hence predisposing the moka pot to producing bitter or burnt coffee?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also raises questions about best practice in moka pot coffee extraction. It would suggest that the best extraction would be when ambient air pressure is lower, the coffee charge is not tamped, the water is heated gradually, and the water is not fully consumed (i.e. the extraction is terminated before the water in the chamber is gone).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My own experimentation would tend to confirm the notion of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tamping the charge, but I have had limited success associating technique with outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have any objective measurements been made with regard to the temperature and pressure inside a moka pot, with the charge tamped or untamped? And how do those measurements compare with the theoretical ideals for coffee extraction?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This is nothing I've tried myself, but to add onto your theory of the heat required to brew the Moka-Pot, I believe we'll arrive at an answer. The problem is not likely the water temperature itself, it turns out it's realistically pretty difficult to get boiling water onto coffee when using some sort of brew method (as the metal absorbs enough heat to drop the water temp). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However the lengthy heat time on the mokapot will actually heat up the ground coffee itself during brew, and this can lead to poor tasting coffee. The best thing you can do, from my understanding is pre-heat the mokapot bottom and start with hot water before assembling and putting on the stove. Additionally, as soon as the coffee starts spurting, it's done and you can run under cool water to halt brewing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got most of this info from a mokapot video I saw a while back, thought it might help you as well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brikka has a safety valve  integrated in the base which should prevent blowing up. However, the coffee will likely be burnt if the steam comes out of the side for a long time. You can try using a lond spoon/knife to lift the weight manually to not waste the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally I would advise against tamping the coffee at all. The amount of pressure it needs to lift the weight and the point where the safety valve opens isn't too far apart. If you tamp, the water needs to exert pressure against the coffee and the weight which is often too much or takes too long.&#xA;The key is to find the correct grind size. Start with too coarse, fill the basket, remove excess from top and don't tamp. The coffee should extract quickly with a sigle &quot;swoosh&quot; but taste and crema will be on the light side.&#xA;Now start reducing the grind size until you hear a bit of a strain in the &quot;swoosh&quot; and it will take a bit longer. This is the point you are aiming for. Since the Brikka does preinfusion, the swelling grounds will provide enough resistance to get the oils out and thus the crema. If the safety valve opens, it was too fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important measure of coffee is taste, so I'd suggest try to get the taste right before worrying about how the crema looks which is very dependent on the beans, their age, the roast. (dark roasts with lots of robusta if you want crema) Keep in mind that not all roasts are equally suited for the brikka and that due to the lower pressure you won't get the same kind of crema a portafilter machine will make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Check for metal shavings, grind the bottom flat (if needed). Remove the filter and sealing in the top part to check there as well.&#xA;Mild soap can be used to remove leftover oils from machining (if present).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Aluminium moka pots, don't use anything abrasive or even midly aggressive (acidic or alkaline) as it will attack the aluminium, instead use coffe to let a protective oil film build up. Some cloth or paper towels can be used to reduce the &quot;patina&quot; from time to time. Immediatly rinsing with water after use (the top part) will keep coffee from drying and sticking and also keep the oil film intact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stainless variants are pretty much immune to wear, except the sealing. However, the filter (in the top part) might also be made from aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Spots on Moka Pot, I suspect they are mold"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have this Bialetti Moka pot for over a year. I wasn't using it very frequently until a couple of months ago. Now I use it almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think in last December, I made coffee and forget to remove the old coffee from the funnel and noticed it after one week. I cleaned it immediately with detergent and even rubbed it with a dishwashing brush... Then I made coffee again and it smelled horrible, like I wasn't able to remove all the leftover coffee. I noticed that some coffee was actually in the filter and I put one of the hairs of the brush inside every hole to get rid of the old coffee residues. Some of them were attached to each other with mold. It was a terrible experience to clean it, it took more than one hour. Then I brewed 2-3 times and throw away the coffee I made, just to make sure everything is actually cleaned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed these spots at this incident. I am not sure if they were there before. I did some research on how to get rid of these spots and realised I shouldn't be cleaning the pot with soap... I don't use soap anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/afYIT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/afYIT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what these spots are. I couldn't get rid of them and I thought maybe it is just oxidation. I still use the pot and coffee tastes normal, as it should be, but rarely I still get the smell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to get rid of these spots? How can I make sure that they are really oxidation? Should I keep using it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;After the first instance of boiling the water in the bottom part, any mold will be dead. Using a soft brush will easily remove it. So this looks like oxidation damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the smell, the filter basket has a layer with holes in it, the underside of which is very hard to clean as you have to get to through the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I suspect the top part. There is a filter and a rubber seal. Remove the seal and clean the &quot;hidden&quot; part of the top filter as well as the the area all the way up. The rubber seal is very likely to have picked up a bad odour. This happens quite often when the moka pot  was too hot and burned the seal, making subsequent cups taste (and smell) like burnt rubber. These rubber seals are cheaply available as a replacement part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Beans can smell like dirt, especially if they are beans that are known for having an earthy flavor profile. What you want to avoid are rancid smelling beans that can get that way due to the oils being over-oxidized over time. Alway check the roasted-on date and don't drink coffee that is several months old. If the bag has an expiration date instead of a roasted-on date, that means they don't want you know how long ago it was roasted. Don't buy those.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Starting from the third pour, the water was taking too long to go through the filter, making the total brewing time of my cup (300ml) was around 7 minutes, while I was trying to replicate the 4:6 method by Tetsu Kasuya, which takes around 3 minutes and a half.

I had a similar problem just the other week when bottling hot syrup with a funnel without ridges: The first one or two were fine, after that, I got that splashing whenever the water film tore for a moment and ultimately had to lift the funnel ever so slightly over the bottle rim to ensure a steady flow. I have had issues with airlock when using a porcelain Melitta filter holder, so I can totally confirm that some types of filter holders do tend to seal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even one of your plastic pieces should already be enough to prevent the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I generally have a flat white with a little sugar.

Starbucks coffee makes me feel physically terrible, and I haven't drunk it for ages. The last time I did I had to sit down as I was nauseus and overcome with tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never found anything that lets me make a great feeling cup of coffee at home. My best feeling cup at the moment is espresso from a mocha, long, with cream and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems like at different times the main factors have been:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The coffee bean&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The roast (dark roast = more anxious)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How it's prepared&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How I consume it (with/without milk, long/short, with/without sugar)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freshness of bean&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freshness of the coffee&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And of course I can't rule out my personal mental and physical health at the time, although caffeine does affect me quite strongly so I tend not to drink it when I'm already feeling anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what are the main factors in how a cup of coffee feels? Is it just personal or is there a way I can optimise for the positive effects? I'm prepared to spend a bit more on the coffee if it feels good.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;So I'm using fresh, semi-skinned, filtered milk in a cold pitcher. My espresso machine is a Sage / Breville Barista Express. I blast my steam wand before I heat the milk as sometimes the first few seconds are just water out the wand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spend the first few seconds adding air to the milk and once it's thickened a bit and the bubbles have gone, I bury the tip and spend the next 40 seconds or so just heating it until it reaches temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I pour my milk, the bit that gets to the spout first tends to look very thin and watery and kind of &amp;quot;below&amp;quot; the rest of the milk, running faster. By the end of the pour it's very thick and frothed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this is because the milk has separated somehow, or the steam wand is somehow adding water to the mix or I'm doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do I get that gloss paint consistency through the whole pitcher?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If the milk is cow fresh... You will have to put it through a process called homogenization. It is normally done when the milk is pasteurized for us who are chained to grocery carts. Homogenization is where the fat of the milk becomes emulsified and it keeps the cream from separating out.

Milk isn't bad for you either, necessarily.  Like anything else though, moderation is key.  Milk does contain fats and sugars.  So if you're watching your intake of these things for health sake, then milk contributes its own parts.  Aside from that, unless you're lactose intolerant, milk is a-okay to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like lattes too but you need to use espresso for that.  Your instant coffee version doesn't sound particularly appetizing to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that whenever I use straight milk in regular coffee, I don't know if its the heat or the acids of the coffee working on the milk, but I get this sour taste after twenty minutes or so. I don't get that flavor with other creamers, even dairy-based creamers. I've started using those flavored Carnation-brand creamers because of it. Oddly, I also don't get that sour flavor when I use straight milk and espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have had no success at low temperature roasting, I have gone through a number of hacked popcorn popper coffee roasters. This requires some tweaking to get the temperature high enough to get a good roast. As a result, I have wasted a few pounds of beans on “low’n’slow” roasts. If you leave the beans in long enough, they will turn dark. But they never develop robust coffee flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A green bean has no flavor. Lots of caffeine, but no flavor. It is the roasting process which converts bean constituents into yummy coffee-flavored chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Maillard Reaction is a specific reaction between amino acids (building blocks of protein) and reducing sugars. It produces specific chemicals like 3-deoxyhexosulose. These products do not provide coffee flavors. Which is good because otherwise your bread and French fries would taste like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you roast beans at Maillard temperatures, you will have brown beans that taste like dark toast. But we don’t drink coffee because it tastes like toast. We drink it because it tastes like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have given up on popcorn popper roasters. They don’t stand up to proper coffee roasting temperatures. I have switched to a BBQ rotisserie basket. With an eye on the thermometer, it does a very good job and leaves the stinky smoke outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Safe or not, I think it comes with the territory.  I've had mine (2 actually) for 5+ years now and it is quite pitted, itself.  I think this is naturally what happens when (mineral) water boils against metals.  I don't know how relevant it is, but I tend to get right to enjoying my coffee, and neglect the moka. Coffee (acidic) seeps down into the reservoir, and I suspect that might contribute to the pitting.  I have no doubt that I've drunk this metal, but thankfully being a food product it is a safe metal; they don't make these things out of lead, you know.  I'm no chemist, biologist or doctor, but I have had a fair amount of experience with a couple of mokas and friends who also use them, and they all inevitably pit.  I don't know if it's safe, but it seems to be the norm, and I have yet to hear of any recalls. Bialetti is a reputable company.

It's called CGA, chlorogenic acid, a highly active polyphenol with glycolytic and insulin-sensitizing properties and, of course, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&#xA;Adding milk to coffee can lower the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid and other polyphenols by binding them to milk proteins, especially beta-lactoglobulin.&#xA;You won't feel the difference so much, you'd have to look at numbers on your blood test to tell that there's something different apart from the taste of the coffee.&#xA;Nothing's gonna be a problem unless you don't have moderation on how much you drink it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Unfortunately, from a latte perspective, the bubbles end up being too big and are more suited to frothy cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have had this machine for two years and had given up on any chance of proper latte art.

They produce only large bubbled&#xA;froth, to be spooned into cappuccino – which is fine if that’s what&#xA;you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, however, you’re wanting to produce lovely, shiny microfoam, with&#xA;much smaller bubbles, for making delicious velvety flat whites,&#xA;cortado/piccolo, macchiato, latte or cappuccino, and to have a go at&#xA;pouring latte art, then panarello isn’t going to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De’Longhi have recognized this, and they have made it very easy to&#xA;simply pull off the panarello to reveal the plastic steam pipe, which&#xA;is essentially a single hole steam tip steam wand&lt;/strong&gt;, or at least works&#xA;in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In truth, it's doubtful that this was actually De'Longhi's intention. Without the outer panarello screwed in, the steam tip is held in place only by friction and - at least once it has been removed and replaced a few times - will frequently pop out from the pressure of the steam. Trying to hold it in place with your thumb or finger is tricky, risks burning your hand and (most importantly!) distracts you from keeping the milk jug in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've tried it a few times and the results have been mixed. Microfoam is certainly more achievable, but so is completely flat, textureless milk! However, there's enough potential there that I'm going to spend a small amount of money on a new panarello and then cut it shorter with a saw so that it can hold the tip in place without adding unnecessary extra air to the milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: Rather than cutting anything, you could also put your finger over the little dimple through which air is added.

The brew ratio is important to extract the right amount of solubles from the coffee, ideally all the pleasant ones and only few of the unpleasant ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you brew with less water, you'll dissolve less of the coffee's goodness, and diluting that will lead to a thin coffee compared to a correctly brewed one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if you brew with too much water, you'll extract bitter substances you won't like, so if you like a thinner coffe (like an americano) it's best to brew normally and then dilute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Aeropress is not really suitable to serve multiple guests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I own a DeLonghi Dedica coffee machine for a year now and recently invested in a good burr grinder (Sage Dose Control Pro). I like drinking long coffees with milk and I’m satisfied with the coffee the DeLonghi machine produces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine comes with pressurized filter baskets, and after doing some research online I found that non pressurized filter baskets can actually produce even better espresso. So I decided to buy a naked portafilter with a non-pressurized filter basket on AliExpress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am still struggling to get something good out of the non-pressurized one. Often it is so strong and bitter that I can’t even finish it and I can’t wrap my head around why this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How is it possible, given the same dose of ground coffee and the same grind setting, that with a pressurized filter basket I can create a coffee that’s actually pretty nice, and it doesn’t even matter how much water runs through the coffee grounds, if my tamp was level, etc., but with the non pressurized basket I can’t get anything drinkable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You will need to grind a lot finer with the non-pressurised baskets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a pressurised filter basket, the resistance is mostly produced by the one tiny hole in the filter basket. For non-pressurised ones, the coffee needs to provide the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the grounds fail to provide enough resistance, the water will run through the coffee really fast, probably creating a bunch of channels which you can usually see as little holes in the coffee bed after the extraction. The problem with the channels is that most of the water goes through the channels (over extracting the coffee there) instead of evenly extracting all available grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Looking for a good pod coffee maker"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm an occasional avid coffee drinker. That is, I don't drink much (at most 1 cup a day, sometimes a few days with 0 cups) but when I do I want it to be (really) good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just want a good cup of regular coffee, and possibly a latte every now and then. I don't care too much for an espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Up until now I've used the freeze dried stuff and sometimes one of those glass wait-and-then-press things. Both of them with mediocre results that leaves me wanting (most likely because I'm in a hurry and don't do it properly).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I want to get better coffee, without breaking the bank and without needing to count seconds or measure precise amounts of anything (both are things I suck at early in the morning). To me the capsule coffee makers seem like the perfect solution. But which one should I get?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are so many of them. Went to a Nespresso store today and they let me taste a coffee from Nespresso Vertuo Next which in all honestly was good (better than what I usually drink) although I kind of expected even better, and when I read reviews about it they were.. mixed (things like the first cup being cold). So I'm back to square one and not knowing what I need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you guys have some tips? I'm hoping to stay within or under 230 USD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Was asked to define a (to me) good cup of coffee. This is hard and I doubt I know the correct terms for what you are asking me to describe.. But I'll give it a stab. I like a well rounded cup, that's not too bitter (I usually stay away from the really dark roast) but I also want a distinct strong coffee taste (not watered down). In my opinion, a good cup of coffee does not need milk or sugar (although I do add milk sometimes, and I do enjoy a latte every now and then). I also want a good crema on the cup. Oh, and it needs to be hot. I hate cold coffee, I want it above 90 degrees celcius.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a vacation to Teneriffa a few years ago I realized that every single little mom and pop shop had this machine (or very similar) and were all extremely good at making a good cup of joe. I have since then not tasted as good coffee as I had during that week again. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back just for the damn coffee.&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmLHG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmLHG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Can I brew espresso with 14g portafilter basket?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Being a complete novice, I've been struggling to brew something that looks like proper espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My machine (Ascaso Dream PID) came with 14 gram portafilter basket (58mm in diameter). Several sources have told me that I really should dose according to the dose label on my basket - no more than +/- 1 gram. I have tried to brew with 14 grams of coffee, but have failed miserably:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My shots always run too fast and the taste is pretty light and sour (underextracted?).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have pushed my grinder (Baratza Sette 270Wi) to the smallest possible grind-size, but it's still too fast. Though at these smallest sizes it's getting pretty tricky to keep the water running evenly through the pack. Again, various sources have told me that I shouldn't go too fine with my grind. The manual of my grinder suggests starting with grind setting 7E for espresso. At that setting with 14 grams of coffee I'm getting a 30g shot in 16 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have experimented with various ways of getting my tamping as consistent and level as possible. My current tamping process as follows: knock the portafilter several times against table to level off the initial pile of grains, spin the leveling tool, press down firmly with tamper.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have fiddled a bit around with pressure. Haven't gone out of the 8..11 bar range. As expected I get a little longer shots with 8 bar. Mostly I've tried to settle to using 9.5 bars.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haven't yet tried changing water temperature - it's been 93 degrees C.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I've tried with a 2 second pre-infusion and without. Not much of a difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's worth mentioning that my timings are measured from pulling the lever - but it takes at least 5 seconds for the first drips to appear (about 9 seconds with pre-infusion).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also worth mentioning is that I'm getting lots of variation from shot to shot with exactly the same settings. Like 31g shot in 22 seconds, and then 34g shot in 17 seconds. This seems to happen more when I go to these finer grind sizes. I suspect uneven extraction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have also used 3 different types of coffee beans. No real difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the smallest possible grind size, 8 bar pressure and 15g coffee I've managed to get 31g shot in 27 seconds. But it tasted very underextracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best results I've had have been when I've increased dose to 17..18 grams. Then I'm able to also use courser grinds. With these doses I'm finally getting some more crema and the taste is no more watery. Though my basket is pretty-much overflowing at such a large dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the espresso-making tutorials I've seen always tend to deal with 18 gram or larger baskets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is there hope in brewing espresso with 14 gram basket (and what should I change)?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Or should I get myself a 18 gram basket and move on (my portafilter seems to have enough room to put a larger basket in).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have a Lelit espresso machine which came, like nearly all other machines, with multiple baskets. I got a double (up to 20g), a small double (up to 18g) and a single (up to 9g) basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine lets me brew phenomenally delicious espresso with the large double basket, which has straight walls and lets the water flow through the coffee evenly. The espresso has a really nice texture, it's neither sour nor bitter, perfectly balanced, very sweet and just very enjoyable in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The single and the small double baskets however only have holes in the middle and are kind of shaped like a funnel. I understand the purpose of this shape, it's to slow the water down so you get similar extraction times with the same grind setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the past few weeks I tried to use the single baskets exclusively to see if I can make single shots instead of having to drink a doppio every time. I have tried adjusting a lot of factors and could not get an espresso that was as good as with the double basket. I tried adjusting temperature, pump pressure, grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction ratio. I have tried using 7,8, and 9 grams of coffee with a brew ratio of 1.8 to 2.5 and none of them were as good as with the double basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what I tried, the espresso always had that channeling taste. It was sour and bitter at the same time. Inspecting the pucks afterwards showed no clear sign of channeling most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this frustrating ordeal I just went back to using the double basket, which clearly makes better espresso (I even did a blind test to see if I can tell the difference, I got 4 out of 4 right).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are single baskets just not made for specialty coffee? Does the funnel shape cause circulation at the edges and therefore higher extraction at the edges compared to the middle of the puck? Is it possible to get an espresso from a single basket that is as delicious as one made with a double basket? If not, can I buy a single basket that has the same shape as a double basket but with room for less coffee? I'm already pretty close to the finest grind setting on my grinder so I'm scared that using less coffee would make it flow faster than I can counteract with grinding finer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes. If you're willing to accept a bit of increased workflow hassle, the La Marzocco 7g basket with an inner straight-walled cylindrical bit (or one of its derivatives) works very well. To use this, you only fill the inner bit (with 6-8 grams) and tamp with a 41mm tamper. When properly dialled in, the basket yields a single that's quite close to, if not indistinguishable from, a split double in terms of taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Downsides of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While not strictly required, a special funnel to fill in the inner bit is practically necessary&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring proper distribution of grounds in the basket is a challenge; some form of WDT seems to be necessary with most grinders&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can't use the same tamper for singles and doubles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Small dose is very sensitive to small variations; weighing each shot is practically necessary in my experience&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the shot's been pulled, there will be not a puddle but a &lt;em&gt;pool&lt;/em&gt; of water on top of the puck. Easy enough to flip and drain into the drip tray, but forget to do this right after the shot, and you'll be left with a soupy mess in the portafilter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The inner cylindrical bit only holds up to about 8g of coffee. With some coffees, this may force a grind size that's too fine and lead to bitterness. I find the LM single basket to be ideal for classical Italian espresso blends designed for smaller doses, but less ideal for third wave coffee. (I wish someone made a 10g LM-style single!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="What are the best single shot filter baskets"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm using a Gaggia classic with the 58mm diameter portafilter that comes with it. I basically only drink single shots, but they are still difficult for me to get right. My grinder is a baratza encore, which I think is part of the difficulty I'm having. The shots have good flavor, but the extraction time is quite short (~15 seconds) and so is the preinfusion time (usually ~2 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I go finer on the grind, I get more bitterness than I'd like. I'm pretty sure that's mostly due to the inconsistent grind from the encore, but it could also be the uneven extraction from the filter basket itself or my tamping technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm using the filter basket that comes with the gaggia, but I'm using a calibrated 30lb tamper that almost exactly fits my portafilter (maybe &amp;lt; 0.5 mm difference in size). Since I'm using a single shot basket, I expect that the tamp force isnt properly distributing over the entire surface of the puck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not ready to invest in a more expensive grinder, should I even bother with a precision filter basket/differently engineered basket?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, what are the aspects to look for? What are the models to consider?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to coffeeSE!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not ready to invest in a more expensive grinder, should I even bother with a precision filter basket/differently engineered basket?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, do not bother with precision filter baskets. The Baratza Encore is definitely not a grinder for espresso, it is meant for brewing methods which use coarser grinds like filter coffee or French press. It cannot grind fine enough properly - you get an inconsistent grind. Baratza offers the Sette series which grinds fine enough and consistent enough to get good espresso. I really wouldn't recommend buying a high end basket until you have a proper grinder, maybe look for used grinders. I got mine super cheap because it was used and after a proper clean it was almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One rule of thumb when getting into espresso is to spend at least as much on your grinder as you spend on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If so, what are the aspects to look for? What are the models to consider?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really do want to experiment with a high precision basket, just look for one which fits your portafilter (shouldn't be too hard since you have a standard 58mm one), is big enough for your desired dose, and is from a somewhat reputable brand (and is ideally used by professionals).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I got an AeroPress about a week ago and I have been experimenting with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm in a temporary country until the rest of the year and I am getting ground coffee online (can only have decaf), so I do NOT control the grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like thick coffees and I bought a metal filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the inverted method, I put one scoop of coffee and then I tried various amount of water for the brew + some dilution afterward. I have tried two different decaf Arabicas from Amazon and I use 80°C water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the results end up the same way: a very watery feel without any texture, a taste that is not very palatable but a very strong over-brewed aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? and how can I make it thicker? Can I create crema with the AeroPress?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;edit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this is the grind size:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vgkbe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vgkbe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to make the texture of your coffee thicker would be to increase your brew ratio - use more coffee and less water while brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also don't be scared to use higher temperature water, even if the inventor recommends ~80°C water, this is also going to increase extraction, leading to a higher percentage of dissolved coffee in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also want to look at this &amp;quot;Coffee Compass&amp;quot; from Barista Hustle, which shows you what adjustments to make based on the taste of the coffee:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/B64AO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/B64AO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Brewed Coffee Compass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

As long as you can clean it properly and it functions normally there is no need to replace it just because you're replacing the gasket, especially when there's no visible corrosion or damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some people who use their Moka Pot very often, don't clean it properly and almost neglect it. They can go through gaskets fairly quickly, my mother used to change it every few months, but she just replaced the filter just once, and that was because she lost the original one.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The process of brewing coffee is chemically speaking an extraction - flavor compounds, caffeine etc. migrate into the hot water (compare to steeping tea). The speed of that process is determined by various factors, temperature and surface/contact area amongst them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For French press, you use a comparatively coarse grind which translates to less surface area than pour over (finer grind) or espresso (really fine). So you have to give the water-coffee mix more time for a good extraction. The customary time, which on average should give the desired results, is four minutes, but you are of course free to experiment with other timings, especially if you are also playing around with grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="When making pour over coffee, why does it sometimes take a very, very long time to drip out of the filter?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I regularly make coffee using a ceramic #2 Melitta-style cone and natural brown filters. Most of the time it works great and consistently makes delicious coffee. But every now and then, the coffee takes a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long time to drip through the filter and out of the cone. More specifically, it normally takes a few minutes for it to fully drip out after pouring on the water, but in these cases it takes in excess of ten minutes. If I lift up the cone, I can see it's only letting out around one drip per second. I often have to apply gentle pressure to the filter to get it to actually drip out the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't found any rhyme or reason as to why this is happening -- changing the size of the ground doesn't help nor does changing to a different coffee. The only thing I haven't changed is trying out a different brand of coffee filters. Could this just be inconsistencies in the production of the filters themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The problem could very well be what Stephie was touching on; very fine coffee dust restricting the flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was having the same issue with my setup and was just going to live with it. That is, until I took off the hopper off of my grinder and saw really finely ground coffee stuck between the splines of the burrs. After brushing out the powder and a couple firm taps it was back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the different beans along with their level of oil, grinds can build up on the the burrs and internals of the grinder rather quickly. After a bit of time the caked on and powdered grounds give way and fall down into the stuff you just grounded. When you try to brew a cup, the smaller lighter coffee grinds/dust flow down to the surface of the filter restricting the flow by blocking all of it's pores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If there is a worry about ingesting tiny flakes of aluminum, you'd have a worse time eating that leftover lasagna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only caveat is if you use too much and it wedges the funnel into the basin and you can't remove it. As a side note, with the pot being much thicker than the funnel, it would also be pretty much impossible to crack it doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have followed his advice and made sure the gasket is in good shape and not indented too much.

If you get down to the lowest setting and the grind isn't getting to the desired level (which you previously did get from the same machine) then there's probably a problem with the way the machine was reassembled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

After trying different flame sizes (i.e. temperatures) and different amounts of water and seeing no change, I'm wondering if there's something else I should do, or some specific temperature/water level/method I should try - like interrupting the extraction midway with cold water as I've seen some people recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the extraction process is sputtering quite a bit, the coffee goes out on high pressure from the start. Maybe despite most of the coffee being quite coarse, it's still clogging the filter with the smaller particles? I'm definitely not tampering, don't even fill all the way through (like 90% filled).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is my analysis correct and the grind is the biggest problem, or is there something else I should experiment with my Moka pot that may work? Should I reserve this coffee for some other method like pouring over, or just give up?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Many of these fully automatic machines heat the milk by combining steam and milk. In my experience, those machines do not take into account the temperature of the milk, they simply mix steam and milk at a fixed ratio. Assuming the steam has a fairly constant temperature, the temperature of the heated milk will mostly depend on the temperature of the cold milk. Simply stated, cooler milk will produce cooler heated milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use milk straight from the fridge, it might be wise to heat it a bit yourself before passing it through the machine. Microwaving the milk you need to slightly below room temperature and then feeding it through the machine's frothing process should increase the temperature of the heated milk. By extension, the temperature of the final drink will be higher as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to pre-heat the milk too much, then the machine could heat it so that you get unwanted chemical reactions (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://perfectdailygrind.com/2019/02/what-temperature-should-your-cappuccino-milk-be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;lactose reacting with proteins&lt;/a&gt;) or that the final product comes out steaming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

In the case of your recipe, most of your extraction would happen during the second wait phase &amp;quot;Wait time (usually 1 minute)&amp;quot;, followed by the second stir phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first bloom phase is usually to let the coffee expunge as much CO2 as possible that's trapped from the roasting process. The CO2, when dissolved can make the coffee more acidic/bitter, hence the blooming phase in your recipe to mitigate that. There is also some extraction during this phase but is rather dwarfed in comparison to the main extraction phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Also use a 1:17 by weight ratio of coffee to tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm interested to know why the coffee I'm making is so muted compared to the other extraction methods I'm used to (pour over, Aeropress, french press). The cup that comes out of this machine is the opposite of bright and citrusy; more like muddy. It's not terrible, but if I add a pinch of citric acid, it certainly brightens up (though there's no accompanying fruity/citrusy smell).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it my grinder, extraction method, or coffee maker?

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;When brewing with 'batch' brew methods, you will always lose some of the nuance and clarity. And the quality of batch brewing machines mostly comes down to the heating element. The best ones I have personally used in cafes and at home is the Technivorm Moccamaster. However if you want to keep using your current machine there are few things you can keep in mind. My first thought is that your quality of grind may produce a lot of fines, leading to a muddy grind even at a coarser setting, however for a batch brew you can go finer than french press. There are also several kinds of acidity that can be present in coffee (chlorogenic, quinic, citric, acetic, lactic, malic, phosphoric, linoleic, and palmitic). It may be you're missing the more lemony or berry notes, which will be easier to taste if it's a natural processed coffee or a variation of honey processed over a fully washed. It could also be age. If a coffee is too fresh, a lot of the flavors get muddled together. If it's too old, the flavor is dry and papery. I personally wait a full week after the roast date before brewing anything. And I recommend only buying coffee that has a roast date on the bag. Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Both issues you're describing, high acidity and weak body, are most probably a result of under-extraction. To increase the balance of the brewed coffee and get a more intense body by increased extraction you have several choices:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Longer brew time. As you said, this is difficult to achieve with a moka pot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increased temperature. This is also practically uncontrollable with a moka pot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind finer. This is probably the variable which has the most effect on your brew. If you grind finer, you get more surface area and higher extraction (all else being equal of course). Keep in mind this will make your coffee less acidic but also more bitter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, a moka pot doesn't allow for much customization and precise adjustments. The only thing I can strongly recommend is to keep everything you're doing the same from brew to brew and only adjust the grind size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't own a grinder and use pre-ground coffee I'm afraid you're out of luck. Getting a cheap-ish hand grinder (usable and consistent hand grinders are available for 30-50$/€) and using freshly ground beans instead of pre-ground coffee is an upgrade I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in deeper exploration of coffee you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyBYuu-wJI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; with 2007 World Barista Champion James Hoffman about how to make a good cup of coffee with a moka pot.

Pressure builds until enough pressure is reached to push steam up into the brew basket at top. There, the steam mixes with coffee and condenses, and brewing occurs. When enough water reaches the upper chamber, coffee brew drips back down to the lower chamber, where the water content can be converted back to steam to support indefinite brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, nutshell, osmotic pressure brewing tries to use osmosis for its extraction mechanism, while percolation uses immersion and heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Issues with grinding my own beans"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I currently use a Delinghi Espresso machine and have always bought ready ground coffee because the cost of a decent grinder is quite high.&#xA;However for Christmas this year, quite a few people bought me coffee beans so I decided to buy myself (what I thought to be) a good budget grinder - Melitta Molino (Melitta seem to have a good name when it comes to coffee particularly when talking about filter coffee)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is... I have been using the Lavazza Espresso beans and generally grind about 10 cups worth at a time.&#xA;I notice that on the day of grinding the water basically runs straight through, there is next to no, dark syrup colour, it tends to start mid brown and within seconds looks clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the next day, however, I get a great coffee, nice dark syrup to begin which gets gradually lighter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used other beans which are generally darker, the lavazza Espresso beans are quite light in colour, I have not noticed this issue with other beans but I'm not sure if that is simply because they are more intense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should coffee brew better a day after grinding? does it let the ground beans dry out or something?&#xA;Or is it something that might be specific to these particular beans?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or might there be something else that is causing the issue?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce your dose.&lt;/strong&gt; Having your puck stick to the brew head means the grounds are in contact with the brew head. If you reduce your dose by 1-2g the surface should be low enough as to avoid direct contact with the brew head. Depending on your brew head you might even get channeling if the surface is too high - immediately below the holes where water comes out it might dig a channel into your puck. If you can see dots on your puck after taking it out, it's probably channeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A wet puck in general also suggest too much coffee or too fine of a grind, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y-EYGSOU7I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this life hack from James Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt;, where he suggests letting the espresso run for a little longer so you can knock it out of the portafilter more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The question is whether adding a specific daily smell test using coffee beans would be worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general thought is to have a cup of coffee beans that you smell on a daily basis. Then report in the app if you had a loss of smell. The ideal test is fast, cheap and easy. To be fast, the container may need to be open so you don't have the daily irritation of having to remove a sealed lid. I considered a coffee bean as I thought they'd be cheap and available around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you'll excuse multiple questions, I have some specific areas I was looking for feedback on....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to get consistency in smell?

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Fresh coffee is neither widely available nor inexpensive in all places. Coffee in Japan is relatively expensive because demand is relatively (extremely) low compared to western nations. I think I remember my coworkers also telling me that fresh coffee in India is almost never used because most Indians so drink coffee prefer instant. I wouldn't trust availability of coffee for this kind of test, but it also can't hurt to include it in the app as an option for people who can get fresh coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say fresh coffee because instant coffee in my experience doesn't have a strong smell in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About smell decay, that depends on a wide range of factors such as time since roasting at time of sale, quality of beans, conditions of storage, and qualities of packaging. My experience with cheap coffees is that they tend to be sold preground (which will lose scents faster than whole bean), though this will not be true in all countries or even all regions within a country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does it even matter though? My interpretation of the &amp;quot;loss of smell&amp;quot; symptom of COVID, having not experienced it myself, is literally a complete loss of smell. It would be far more reliable to advise acquiring a new bag of coffee and seeing if you can smell it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then again, there are loads of more economical options. Basically every spice under the sun (onion powder, garlic powder, curry powder, chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, thyme, rosemary, etc.), aromatic vegetables like onions and garlic, vinegar, fish or fish oil, and other aromatic foods might be more widely available at lower prices than coffee in most places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It's used for 2 people to make coffee in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, settings are 93 degrees on the PID, grind around 3 (a nudge above). 15.5g ground beans in for 30s/ 30g out. No tamping, only distributing with a distributer. Backpressure sits around 11 bar at the end of the green zone on the gauge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That works well for the first shot I pull, it's dialled in so to speak. Taste is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second shot, prepared the same way, at 93 degrees, 15.5g grounds in, distributed comes out way faster, usually after 20s I've got the 30g of coffee in the cup. Backpressure is lower too by a bar and a bit, which is expected with higher flows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is beyond me because the same coffee puck should result in the same coffee flow, which is not happening and I cannot understand why. Dose is the same, grind is the same, packing is the same, temperature is the same yet the espressos are wildly different between coffees 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I leave the machine alone for 20 minutes while drinking this coffee and make another set of 2 coffees, I experience the same fluctuation again, first shot fine, second shot fast.

        <Body Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No tamping&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Start tamping your coffee. Without tamping channels form a lot easier, making your shot pour a lot faster and making your coffee taste sour and bitter at the same time. If you still manage to get 11 bars of pressure somehow without tamping, I'd assume your coffee is ground way too fine anyways, making it even more likely to form channels since they offer less resistance than the puck itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the first shot flows slower than the second one probably boils (no pun intended) down to a colder brew head. If you're not doing this already try flushing your brew head and portafilter to get them hot (so hot you barely manage to hold it for a few seconds) before pulling a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with Costa, but I am with Starbucks. Let me offer my ideas in what's different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks stores use fully automatic espresso machines with semi automatic frothing wands. The espresso machines make true espresso, unlike all of the brewing options you mentioned. This is the main reason the coffee is better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The frothing wand also uses steam to froth the milk which creates a wonderfully creamy texture in the milk. Stick and pitcher frothers can't make the performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also grind. Starbucks stores use high quality coffee grinders that grind the coffee quite consistently. Coffee used for espresso is ground on demand for each shot. Your coffee at home might suffer if you're not grinding right before your brew or if you're grinding with a lower quality grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, drink recipes. Starbucks cups are printed with volume markers to help baristas match recipes exactly. When you buy a latte at Starbucks, the ratio of espresso to milk is ideal and is the same every time. Unless you're measuring at home and know what that ideal ratio is, you're likely not hitting the right recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get coffee shop type lattes at home, you need a real espresso machine. A single boiler unit with a steam wand will do the trick, but nothing short of one will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Ideal brewing time varies based on grind. Finer grinds need shorter brew times. Coarser grinds need longer brew times. This is because fine grinds expose more surface area of the beans, which lets solutes diffuse quickly into the water. Coarse grinds need more time for solutes to be drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for roast level, that's totally up to you. Different roast levels expose different flavor profiles, so you might like them all brewed for the same amount of time or you might prefer to brew darker or lighter roasts for longer or shorter times. There's not really an ideal here unless you align with the preferences of the person offering you the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll know that your brew time is too long if your coffee tastes bitter. Coffee brewed perfectly should taste very smooth if you're using medium or lighter roasts. Very dark coffees might taste bitter in a burnt sort of way even with perfect brewing. Conversely, too short brew time will result in weak tasting coffee.

    <Title Title="What benefits does a Moccamaster offer compared to a generic coffee maker?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I am currently using a moka pot and a Hario hand grinder to make my morning brew. I try to buy freshly roasted ground beans but sometimes I still end up buying some bags from the supermarket. I drink about 2-3 cups of coffee a day at most, my partner drinks probably 5-6 but some of that is instant coffee. I truly hate the flavour of instant coffee but using the moka pot multiple times a day is hassle so I end up drinking some instant during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of upgrading to a coffee machine and an electric burr grinder. I'd like to buy something like a Moccamaster which could brew a few cups of coffee at a time, which we could drink throughout the day. I was just wondering if anyone who has ever used it would recommend it for a non-expert coffee drinker or should I just stick to a manual pot? Is the difference noticeable between a Moccamaster and a generic cheap coffee maker and does it truly last longer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A Moccamaster is like any other electric drip brewer. It takes water and ground coffee and it brews a pot of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the difference noticeable between a Moccamaster and a generic cheap coffee maker and does it truly last longer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I've read online, the Moccamaster is a decent brewer. As far as electric brewers go, I think that mostly refers to consistency. All the machine does is adding hot water to the grounds, so consistency means:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water is added to the grounds at the same temperature regardless of the temperature of the cold water you're adding in the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water is dispersed somewhat equally over the coffee in the filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the good reviews (and no personal experience) I'm sure that it will do the job as good as any other generic brewer. As for build quality, I think it's a decent design (premium materials even compared to the mostly plastic machines in lower price segments) that won't disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at current retail prices though (about €200 in Europe or $300+ in the US), I can't help but mention that it's a steep price for adding hot water to grounds consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are there other machines which do a comparable job at a lower price? Definitely. The easiest way to find such a machine at a lower price is to look at a price comparison website for your own locale that includes customer reviews. Simply look for for drip brewers between $/€40-120 and sort them by rating. Then, to make sure that there are no hidden flaws (poor build quality, inconsistent brewing) you search for reviews of the candidate machine(s) online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I mention looking in your own locale is that some machines are priced reasonably well in one locale, but they're more expensive in another. I think the Moccamaster is a good example of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I've seen some genuine recommendations for Moccamasters as well though in a slightly different context. The Moccamaster has been around since the sixties and it's produced by a Dutch company. As such, there are a lot of used machines out there and I've seen people recommend those &lt;strong&gt;used&lt;/strong&gt; machines on Dutch coffee sites. Obviously, you wouldn't pay full retail price for a used machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At around $/€100, I think a used but good quality Moccamaster could be an alternative to a new brewer at that same price. For that price, you get a slightly sturdier build quality (copper coil for heating the water and a metal body). At the retail price, you are paying for the brand an the nostalgic factor as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;How many are too many for a day depends on which you're using. As you suspect, different pods might have different levels of caffeine. Darker roasts tend to have less caffeine, while lighter roasts and flavored coffees likely have more caffeine. From what I can tell, it looks like Nespresso pods ought to vary between 50 and 150 milligrams per pod with the majority of varieties in the 70-80mg range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding caffeine consumption, please understand that we are not doctors and cannot provide medical advice. Everyone is affected differently by caffeine. If you're looking for your own limit, start at 2 Nespresso brews per day (140-200mg) and work from there. Also, coffee itself isn't generally harmful to people, though sweeteners, including milk (lower fat milks tend to be higher in sugar), can be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, regarding caffeine extraction, the answer depends on some variables. Coffee grind size, water temperature, brew time, brew method, and amount of caffeine in the coffee all affect this. For the Nespresso, which uses pressure to draw a relatively short extraction somewhat like an espresso machine, the first brew probably extracts about 60% of the caffeine, while a second brew of a once-used pod might get you 80%. This is just a guesstimate based on what I know about espresso brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You absolutely want to be able to choose grind size&lt;/strong&gt; - even if you have a preferred brewing method and beans, you still want to be able to make some adjustments up or down if necessary. Even more so if you are going to experiment with brewing methods, where the required grind size ranges from super fine powder (Turkish Mokka) to coarse grain (cold brew). And it is a good idea to pick a grinder that has its strength at the coarseness you need most - few will actually cover the whole range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the really important detail is how &lt;strong&gt;homogeneous&lt;/strong&gt; the grind is. If you have a wide range of particle sizes, you will get over &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; under extracted coffee at the same time and it will be a compromise at best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I would &lt;em&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/em&gt; that you invest in a &lt;strong&gt;burr grinder&lt;/strong&gt;, that should be the kind where you can set and adjust the grind size. As said before, read a few reviews before selecting the model that matches your needs and budget.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blade grinders&lt;/strong&gt; work like food processors, chopping up the beans with a rotating knife and the longer they run, the finer the grind will be - so the time you run them is sort of a grind selector. By design they produce a less homogeneous result (depending on how the blade hits the beans, some particles will be bigger, some smaller), which will sometimes work for coarse grinds, but not for fine ones. They are often cheaper, though, which is why some users pick them over burr grinders. I would not choose one if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why some pros recommend to spend equal amounts on your grinder and your espresso machine. If you are brewing with a low-budget method (e.g. pour-over by hand), the grinder will likely be the most expensive piece of equipment - and probably worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Key to understanding this is the &lt;strong&gt;flow rate&lt;/strong&gt; of the hot water: Fine grains = slow flow rate; coarse grains = fast flow rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grain size determines how quickly the hot water flows, and thus how much time it is contact with the grains. Faster flow means the water has less time to be in contact with the grains and thus less time the water can extract the oils and other nutrients. (Certainly, surface area factors in, too; cf. &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/5606/8287&quot;&gt;Stephie's answer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Methods where the grains are soaked (cold-brew, French press, pour-over) don't require fine grains.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;To me, this sounds like &lt;strong&gt;channeling&lt;/strong&gt;. When you brew espresso the machine pushes water through a puck of compressed coffee grounds. Ideally, the grounds are distributed equally throughout the puck so that the water passes through the puck evenly. In reality, there will always be small inconsistencies. These inconsistencies allow water to move through slightly faster, possibly moving some of the inconsistent grounds along the way. When too many grounds are moved so that there is an opening from the top to the bottom of the puck, you've got a channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The channel provides a path of low resistance through the puck, so a lot of the water will pass through there rather than through the compressed parts of the puck. This extra water flow through the channel will widen it even more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water passing through the channel comes into contact with only a small portion of the grounds in the puck. As such, the grounds around the channel are overextracted while the water coming out is lightly colored and overly bitter. It's lightly colored because it has less contact with the grounds. Nevertheless, it will be bitter because the grounds in the channel are already fully extracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To confirm that your puck has actually suffered from channeling, simply look at the top of the puck after brewing. If the channel is big enough, you will see some holes in the puck (while it's still in the portafilter).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a naked portafilter (one where you can see the bottom of the filter basket) you will be able to see channeling during the brew process. An even extraction will be a gentle singular stream whereas channeling will look like thin high pressure streams. Because a video says more than a wall of text, I'd recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHG1EWbrk9Q&amp;amp;ab_channel=WholeLatteLove&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video by Whole Latte Love on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you don't have a naked portafilter, it will be interesting to see how espresso exits the portafilter. Note that the shots in the video are all pretty good with some minor channeling. If the tamp is really bad (not shown in the video), I would expect there to be many more of those tiny jets which turn lighter in color fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This shuffling is done because when you do it, the coffee granules/particles release its &lt;em&gt;flavors&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I've heard similar &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;em&gt;flavor&lt;/em&gt; thing heard from a few of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2:&lt;/strong&gt; One comment under my &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/102511/can-you-make-coffee-by-boiling-it&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; question says you can make this kind of coffee by just adding boiling water and milk and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to use instant coffee, just pour hot water on it, add&#xA;milk to taste, and you're done&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can use the method suggested by Chris H, as ingredients are same and it will save a lot of my precious time but I'm just surprised I don't see any tutorial on it on YouTube. So I wonder if it is right method or wrong or it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a right method but pretty rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, do both methods actually cause a difference in taste about its flavor or make it more thick? I mean the flavor reason given by the YouTube user is actually a scientific reason? Or could be just his personal opinion?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Of course, there would be a difference in taste, but I'm more concerned about his &lt;em&gt;flavor&lt;/em&gt; logic)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: Why I think that the YouTube user is right about &lt;em&gt;releasing flavors&lt;/em&gt; thing is because it turns to creamy thing after some time. So it feels like something has chemically changed inside it. So I feel that's the reason it tastes different. But I need to verify this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Basically, all the method does is aerate the mixture, pre-dissolving the solids slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't see how it can possibly affect the flavour unless the resulting 'crema' [for want of a better description] might affect the taste perception, as it does in real coffee.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The acidity level of brewed coffee is mainly influenced by three factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkness of roast, with lighter roasts generally resulting in higher concentrations of acidic compounds and darker roasts resulting in lower concentrations&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grind size, with finer grinds enabling greater extraction of acidic compounds (due to greater exposed surface area) and coarser grinds preventing extraction of acidic compounds retained inside the grinds&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duration of brewing method, with shorter duration brewing methods like espresso generally producing a more acidic brew than longer duration brewing methods like drip or French press&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in general, if you want the least acidic brew you can get, opt for either drip or French press with a dark roast. French press will generally produce a less acidic cup than drip with the same batch of roasted coffee because the grind size difference is quite large.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's a combination of scale (mineral deposits left behind by water left in the pot evaporating), oxidized aluminum (caused by exposure of aluminum to oxygen), and coffee deposits (coffee oils and solids left behind by evaporating brew / wet grounds).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen this with several aluminum pots when they get to be years old. Also steel if you don't keep up with the cleaning. You can remove scale with a coffee machine descaler product (recommend DEZCAL by Urnex), oxidized aluminum with a diluted solution of vinegar, and coffee deposits with a mix of vinegar and baking soda (mixed in the pot with your cleaning tool on standby because they will start reacting immediately).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just one bit of advice. Use a rotary tool (like Dremel, if you have one) with a buffing pad. You're going to have one tough time cleaning inside those grooves using a scrubbing pad. A rotary tool with a soft attachment like for polishing or buffing will make the job much easier. Electric toothbrushes work wonderfully too in places they can actually fit/reach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Short answer is no, though you can use a common kitchen scale to minimize (but not eliminate) waste. Measure in grams if you're not already and if your scale supports it for greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basket on your pot has a fixed volume. Coffee within a particular roast batch will also have fairly consistent density. This means that you should be able to use very nearly the same &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot; of coffee per brew. Measure your coffee with a kitchen scale to get an idea of how much it takes to fill the basket, then in the future grind or scoop that amount in weight including the excess you will later level off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leveling off is important. If you don't level off your basket with a moka pot, you'll significantly increase the volume of steam required to produce enough pressure to push the coffee up the tube. That's bad because it'll add some variables into your brew routine that are impossible to control. Use more heat or brew longer to get more steam and you could burn your coffee, but because you wouldn't get the same surface distribution with each brew, the amount of steam you need would change per brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So look at it like this: dumping 1ish gram of coffee grounds per brew is not nearly as bad as dumping an entire dose because you ruined your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're really worried about dumping that bit, get yourself an airtight food canister and use it to store leftover grounds for your next brew. That coffee will go stale right quick, but since it's such a small amount, it won't dramatically affect the next brew regardless. Waste nothing if you save what you level off!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think there are two sides to cleaning a French press: the metal filter which may have some grounds stuck onto it and the bottom of the brewing vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To clean the metal filter, I unscrew the plunger and wash the metal parts that hold the filter with a bit of soap and water (or put them in the dishwasher). The metal filter is more difficult because there might be grounds that don't wash off easily. To get most of the grounds out, I apply a bit of soap and then hold it under a steady stream of running water. I think the soap holds onto any coffee residue and then the force of the water water pushes it all out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To clean the brewing vessel with the coffee grounds, I add more water so the grounds get mixed with the water. Then I dispose of everything in a mesh kitchen strainer. If some grounds remain in the beaker, I hold it under the running tap, the water stream dislodges the grounds and it's all disposed in the strainer. When the grounds are all in the strainer, there may still be some oily residue in the beaker, just clean that off with some soap and water (or use the dishwasher).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, now you've just moved the grounds problem to the strainer. Luckily, the grounds dry easily because the water drips out underneath. When it's relatively* dry, you can easily remove most of the grounds into the garbage / compost bin. The few remaining grounds which may be stuck to the strainer can be removed similarly to the way I described cleaning the metal filter (just rinse under the tap). This should be a bit easier because you can use a relatively coarse strainer for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* If you don't want to wait, rapid vertical movements (open side facing up) with the strainer remove enough water for the grounds to come out in one piece.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;h2&gt;Oily surfaces are related to roast level&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think oily beans are related to roasting time as you say in your question. Instead, oily beans are characteristic of a darker roast. Roasting levels are primarily related to the internal temperature of the beans, the higher the internal temperature of the bean, the darker the roast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting#Roasts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has an overview of different roast levels. Three of the roast levels in their overview mention an oils on the surface of the beans (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;225 °C (437 °F), Full City Roast&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Medium-dark brown with &lt;strong&gt;dry to tiny droplets or faint patches of oil&lt;/strong&gt;, roast character is prominent. At the beginning of second crack, body is fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;230 °C (446 °F), Vienna Roast&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderate dark brown with &lt;strong&gt;light surface oil&lt;/strong&gt;, more bittersweet, caramel flavor, acidity muted. In the middle of second crack. Any origin characteristics have become eclipsed by roast at this level&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;240 °C (464 °F), French Roast&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dark brown, &lt;strong&gt;shiny with oil&lt;/strong&gt;, deep caramel undertones, acidity diminished. At the end of second crack. Roast character is dominant, little of the inherent aroma or flavors of the coffee remain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia doesn't list the oily surface explicitly for the darkest roast: the Italian roast. Instead, it just describes it as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;nearly black and shiny&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, the Italian roast has a very oily surface, as described by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/blog/2009/05/20/italian-roast-vs-french-roast/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;article form Seattle Coffee Gear&lt;/a&gt; which compares the French and the Italian roast levels:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we know that there are die-hard devotees of dark roasted coffee and we were recently asked what the difference was between French Roast and Italian Roast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They're both roasted quite darkly, so that they have an oily sheen to them after the roasting process is complete. With a French Roast, the temperature of the roast is high enough that these oils are brought to the surface and will impart a roasted flavor to the produced coffee or espresso. Aromas can vary from berry to citrus. Italian Roast is much darker and oilier than a French Roast and often preferred in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Oily vs. non-oily beans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it makes sense to say that one is better than the other. In comparing the two, I think it's better look at light vs. dark roasts because there are more factors at play. As a general rule I would say that the darker the roast, the more prominent the roast profile becomes over the origin characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another note about oily beans is that they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://espressocanada.com/blogs/news/how-oily-coffee-beans-can-ruin-your-espresso-machine-and-coffee-taste&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;leave more residue&lt;/a&gt; in your grinder (and other parts of the machine where the beans pass through).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Does which grind setting you use also depend on the beans used?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;So - I use an automatic bean-to-cup espresso machine. The grinder within the machine has 5 grind levels - 5 being the most coarse, 1 being the most fine. Out of the box, it was pre-set to 3, which did absolutely fine with the beans I initially used. But I've noticed recently that some of the cups have been really sour, and tasted as though they have been under-extracted. After changing the grind setting to 1 with the recent beans I was using, it tastes just fine again. Is it in my head or does the grind setting you should use really also depend on the beans you are using? If so, I am intrigued, why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's not just your head! Different roast batches will benefit from different grind settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, this is partly because different roast levels will result in beans that contain different compounds. This is because the heat or roasting causes chemical changes in some of the bean's compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, roasting causes water in the bean to boil off as steam. This process both affects the durability of the bean and the actual structure of the bean. First, a drier bean (resulting from a darker roast) is more brittle and is more likely to shatter, producing fines, during grinding. Second, the process of rapid boiling of the bean's water content caused a buildup of pressure inside the bean which makes beans &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; during roasting, much like popcorn (but with coffee we call it &amp;quot;cracking&amp;quot;). Dark roasts tend to undergo two cracks during roasting, while light and medium roasts undergo one or stretch just into the beginning of the second crack. This process of crafting the bean create channels in the bean that expose more surface area in darker roasts right out of the roast, without any grinding at all. This structural change contributes further to the frailty of the beans and the likelihood of shattering during grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the reason why you see polar opposite recommendations from various coffee pros on how to grind light vs dark roasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People actually disagree on whether to grind light roasts more finely or coarsely than dark roasts. I don't want to suggest either approach. Rather, I just mean to explain that due to natural differences between bean harvests and differences introduced to roast batches via the cleaning, drying, and roasting processes, no two batches of coffee are quite the same. The differences become less pronounced with &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dark roasts like you often find in coffee shops in the US, but when buying smaller batch coffee at home that isn't roasted quite so dark, you'll often find that two bags of the same brand and blend bought on the same day with the same roast date aren't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same and the one bag might do better with minor adjustments to your grinder between bags. And sometimes, especially when moving from one brand or blend to another, you'll see vast differences in your brew process using the same grind setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, which grind setting you use depends on the beans you're using. Unfortunately, there's no great way to tell what grind setting to use until you do your first brew and observe the differences from what you expect. Just don't be surprised if you see big differences between bags or especially between brands/varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The short answer here is that that device is not up to the job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider how microfoam is typically achieved in coffee shops compared to this device. Espresso shops use steam for a reason. Steam is a very effective mechanism for injecting both steam and air into milk while simultaneously agitating the milk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your device, on the other hand, heats the milk from the bottom and stirs it with a little paddle attached to a motor. The stirring action pulls air in and incorporates it into the milk via stirring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The steam method is more effective at producing microfoam because you can control the amount of air injected. You have no control when using this device, so the device is designed to overcompensate. It uses a slow heating method and aggressive stirring to achieve a high degree of frothing because many people who use this type of frother are comparing it to a stick frother and not to a steam wand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The problem (for you) with espresso is that the amount of coffee brewed per serving is small and it tends to lose heat faster than, let's say, a mug of filter-brew coffee from a jar that has been sitting on a hot plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found some interesting information on:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.1stincoffee.com/art-of-making-espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.1stincoffee.com/art-of-making-espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brewing temperature is the temperature of the water at the point&#xA;where it comes into contact with the ground coffee. This temperature&#xA;is controlled by the thermostat of the espresso machine and should be&#xA;88C to 91C. The temperature of the brew in your cup will be between 71&#xA;and 74C. The heat loss occurs in the brew group, the air, and the cup.&#xA;This is the ideal temperature for espresso in order to feel hot&#xA;without scalding. To keep the beverage temperature from being too low,&#xA;you should preheat the brew group and the cup. The easiest and most&#xA;reliable way to heat the brew group and the cup is to run the cycle&#xA;once with water only. This will heat the brew group, including the&#xA;portafilter, and the cup simultaneously. A cup warmer will also help&#xA;keep cups warm when you are making multiple espresso beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my experience, excessively hot espressos ( &amp;gt; 80C ) like the ones served in restaurants in my country tend to yield a horrible burnt taste and are a telltale of a bad barista or a malfunctioning machine&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

This approach is known not to be a good practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience, I could say the most notable changes that you could note in Turkish coffee is twofold: it should be fresh and quick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freshness is important as the grounds are as fine as flour. So, they stale very quickly. One of the reasons that people have traditional hand grinders is this. Ground just before you prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quick preparation is important to be able to extract more before the all the flavor has been evaporated. That's why you need a pretty good cezve with a decent stove to transfer heat as quickly as possible. It is said that whole preparation must take under two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OF course there are many details regarding any kind of coffee preparation. I believe these two could be the first things to change. Unfortunately, Turkish coffee preparation requires serious experience and the learning curve is steep.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly normal for the grounds to fall to the bottom relatively soon, even before pressing. In fact, you don't even need to press, you can just use the plunger as a strainer when you're done brewing. If your coffee tastes too sour, it is most probably &lt;strong&gt;underextracted&lt;/strong&gt;. A weak (&amp;quot;light&amp;quot;) body also hints at underextraction. To increase extraction you can let it brew for a longer amount of time, use hotter water, stir it or (the only really sane and repeatable solution) &lt;strong&gt;grind the coffee finer&lt;/strong&gt;.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;While I cannot answer with certainty if the coffee was indeed &amp;quot;awful&amp;quot; because there is no way for me to know, I can answer with a few things that can make espresso more acidic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roast level&lt;/strong&gt;. When coffee is roasted it starts to gain sweetness (it's essentially caramelising) and roasty notes like chocolate and nuts. This happens at the expense of acidity and fruity flavours.&#xA;Places that sell specialty coffee usually have lighter roasts, so that the origin characteristics of the beans do not get lost. While light roasts can undoubtedly be sweet too, they tend to be more acidic and complex than darker roasts. Because espresso is so concentrated and more intense than filter coffee, many shops even roast their beans differently for filter and espresso, to prevent the exact thing that happened to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variety&lt;/strong&gt;. Some varieties of Arabica tend to be more acidic than others. For example, the varieties Marsellesa, Starmaya, and SL28 will generally be more acidic and complex than Caturra and Mundo Novo. Of course, the roast level will also impact the acidity that is perceived in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing&lt;/strong&gt;. In general, simple terms, there are two ways of drying the coffee bean - with its cherry still attached or with the cherry removed and washed away. The former is called &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; and the latter method is called &lt;em&gt;washed&lt;/em&gt;. Because natural coffee is in contact with the cherry (which is a fruit of course) for a longer time, some of the flavours of the cherry can end up in the bean, which give the coffee a more balanced taste, making it seem less acidic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Under)extraction&lt;/strong&gt;. When extracting coffee with any method, you want to be in the sweet spot for extraction. If you brew it for too long, it will taste bitter, dry, powdery, or dusty. On the other hand, if you brew it too fast it will be underextracted and taste &lt;strong&gt;sour&lt;/strong&gt;, vegetal, or bland. Get it right and the coffee should taste sweet, complex, fruity, and slightly acidic (not like a lemon but think more of a pleasantly juicy green apple).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these things considered, it is important to note that for someone who is used to classically roasted coffee, which you can get at most cafes, specialty coffee will definitely be much more acidic than they are used to.&#xA;It very well may be that the barista was convinced and genuinely thought that the coffee wasn't acidic compared to the other coffees he had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

The problem is, every pot of coffee I make with freshly-ground beans comes out thin and watery. Or, if I add more coffee (or modify the grind size) over-extracted and watery. I don't have this same problem with using pre-ground stuff from the supermarket in the same coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use a pretty standard Hamilton Beach drip maker on &amp;quot;Regular&amp;quot; setting.

I've since brewed more than 20 pots have not yet had a single one that I wanted to finish; I've varied grind sizes, coffee portions, tried different roasts...nothing comes out right. I've tried both exacting measurements and seat-of-the-pants tablespoons but always come up short. I've compared my ground beans to the store-bought stuff to make sure it's the same but still no luck. The only coffee to come of the grinder that was drinkable is the coarsely-ground coffee I've made into cold brew. I also experimented with a french press but gave up in frustration there as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like a good cup of coffee but also don't want much fuss in the morning.

For example 1:15 which means you use 1 part coffee to 15 parts water (both measured by weight).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way to explain a watery result is that you're using too little coffee for the amount of water you're adding. If it tastes over-extracted when you increase the dosage (the amount of coffee) then you might be grinding too fine. An easy way to check for this is by grinding coarser and sticking to the aforementioned brew ratio. If it tastes over-extracted at that ratio then it means your grinds are too fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are many variables that affect the final cup (in any type of brewing):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brewing technique (even with cold brew you can change factors like grind size, steeping in the fridge or at room temperature, brew time, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of roast (as you say lighter versus darker roasts)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of bean (different origins and how the bean was processed from a fruit to a green bean)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&quot;type-of-bean-ay0k&quot;&gt;Type of bean&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the type of bean. Some origins are more acidic than others. One indicator is the altitude at which the coffee is grown: a higher altitude results in a more acidic bean, which generally leads to more complex fruity flavors. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://perfectdailygrind.com/2015/06/how-does-altitude-affect-coffee-and-its-taste-in-the-cup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a blog by perfectdailygrind&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason that higher elevation coffee is more sought after is the taste. When well-cared for, high elevation coffee will produce the more acidic, aromatic and flavorful cup of coffee that we love, while lower elevation coffee tends to have a lower acidity with little character in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want less acidity, you might want to consider beans cultivated at lower elevation. Two low altitude beans are &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/04/18/the-fascinating-history-and-renewal-of-brazils-yellow-bourbon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brazil's Yellow Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; (also popular as a bean for espresso) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.konacoffeeandtea.com/blog/kona-coffee-tasting-notes-2019&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kona coffee from Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; (quite expensive and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kona_coffee#Kona_blends&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;there may be blends with a high proportion of other beans mixed in&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the aspect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Dry_process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;natural processed&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Wet_process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;washed&lt;/a&gt;. Washed coffees are more widely available and &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/181&quot;&gt;they are also less acidic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&quot;type-of-roast-a115&quot;&gt;Type of roast&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the darker the roast the more pronounced the bitter flavors will prevail over the acidic flavors. Nevertheless, choosing a dark roast means you will mostly taste the flavors determined by the roast rather than the ones acquired by growing the bean. If you want to have some variety, I would suggest looking for medium roasts so different origins provide different taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&quot;brewing-technique-1vmp&quot;&gt;Brewing technique&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As indicated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1673&quot;&gt;an answer to this question about roast levels and cold brew&lt;/a&gt;, cold brew produces a less acidic cup compared to hot brewing methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for brewing time, I think 18 hours at room temperature is a good starting point. According to this guide by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homegrounds.co/how-long-to-steep-cold-brew/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;homegrounds.co&lt;/a&gt; increasing the time risks getting an overly bitter result while a much shorter extraction can yield a weak cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind size is one of the factors that you can play with to change the bitterness / acidity tradeoff after you've settled on a particular coffee. The finer you grind, the more you favor bitter flavors over acidity. Remember though that you don't want too grind too fine as that will clog up your filter (regardless of the system you are using) and it might produce a muddy result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew ratios are about the ratio of coffee beans to water. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.northstarroast.com/cold-brew-coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;North Star roasters recommend&lt;/a&gt; are ration of 1:8 which is one part coffee beans / grinds to 8 parts water (by weight). They describe more concentrated ratios but they mention that affects brew time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I think you can get to an enjoyable cup by focusing on just two variables:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the roasted beans. As stated before, there is less variability if you stick to darker roasts. With medium roasts the taste will differ more based on origin and growing conditions. Beans from Brazil are commonly available and I think they are a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varying the grind size to finetune. Once you've settled on a bag of beans this is probably the factor to focus on. If you keep everything else the same (the same beans, the same brew time, etc.) then you can increase or decrease the bitterness by grinding coarser or finer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

And I get a froth instead? &lt;strong&gt;Could this be due to mixing it on a higher/quicker level?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. Rudimentary speaking the process of whipping something is adhering air bubbles to the fats in your mix (similar to soap bubbles, where the fats act as the soap). The finer these air bubbles are, the finer and more creamy the mixture appears. If you whack it at high speed, it will create large air pockets, which at the next time the whisk comes around at speed either collapse, or create more large air bubbles. Mixing at lower speeds will create smaller bubbles, which at next rotation can subdivide into smaller and smaller bubbles, giving you the smooth consistency you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't go too low though, as you'll just be stirring the mixture instead and not incorporating any air. The best way to create the right consistency is doing so on a &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; setting taking roughly 5-6 minutes to whip up your coffee (or longer depending on the amount of mix, more mix takes more time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think these are mostly marketing terms. What they're saying in those ads is that the machine has a pump that is able to provide 15 bar (or more on in some cases) of pressure. In practice, the pump pressure should be a bit more than the pressure you want to brew at so that you can reach and maintain that pressure when brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having a stronger pump isn't a bad thing (and it may be the standard because of other use cases for those pumps; I'm not sure) but it's not going to give you any benefits. It's a bit like having a race car in traffic, it won't hurt but you're not going to go faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 9 bar figure you're referring to is commonly cited as an ideal brew pressure. For example, James Hoffmann mentions it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/po3oGIicu-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;his video&lt;/a&gt; on pressure for espresso brewing. He describes it as an ideal brewing pressure because of the associated flow rate which depends on the amount of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the 9 bar figure isn't set in stone, there's definitely room for experimentation, possibly by changing the pressure during the brew (assuming the equipment supports that). An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baristamagazine.com/changing-espresso-extraction-with-scott-rao/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;article in Barista Magazine&lt;/a&gt; describes Scott Rao's experimentation with pressure profiling. He had good results with a long pre-infusion where pressure increases slowly, peaking  at 9 bar followed by a slow drop in pressure. With a 60+ second extraction and 25% more solubles, he got positive feedback. One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEXLftYYV8o&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;experiments was also featured in a James Hoffmann video back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is 15 bar or 20 bar a good thing to have, compared to 9 bar?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer the question directly, I don't think it hurts (or benefits) to have that high pump pressure. As a brewing temperature though, I don't think it's used much. As explained in the first video I linked, too much pressure may further compress the coffee puck in a way that may harm the flow of water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;To get consistent results, you should have consistent steps. Specifically, I'd pay attention to these four factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brew ratio&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brew temperature&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brew time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grind size&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I aim for a brew ratio of 1:15 measured by weight (so I'd add 750 grams of water to 50 grams of coffee). This is mostly because it's easy to calculate and you can of course choose a slightly different ratio if you like a stronger or weaker cup. I'd say anywhere between 1:13 to 1:18 is fine, but you'll want to keep track of the ratio you're using so you can reproduce it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for brew temperature, I think you should aim to start as hot as possible. For me that means preheating the brewing vessel with water that's just off the boil (as in, it has stopped boiling by the time I've taken it to the French press, no need to wait). So you fill the French press with hot water just to heat it (I add about 200 mL for an 800 mL beaker) and then you discard it (or use it to heat the cups) just before you add the grinds. The water you use for brewing may be just off the boil as well, but if you took it for preheating like a minute ago (but not much longer) and you don't feel like getting it to a boil again then that's fine too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for brew time, I would increase the time to 6-9 minutes. The added brew time should benefit the result. See also the linked video below which recommends 4+5= 9 minutes of total brewing time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind size doesn't have to be super coarse, just not so fine as to clog the filter. In his video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/st571DYYTR8?t=101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;James Hoffmann recommends a medium grind&lt;/a&gt;, that's a bit ambiguous but he uses it to steer people away from the often recommended (super) coarse. I'd say, if you keep all the other parameters as I described and the cup is still to weak, then go finer incrementally until you like it keeping all the other factors the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've recommended that linked video to others before, but in hindsight I think he's taking some unnecessary steps. For example, he scoops off some grinds and he doesn't plunge down past the surface of the coffee with the idea that more fines will have sunk to and remain at the bottom and the filter acts as a strainer when you pour it (rather than when you push down). I guess the technique is worth trying if you're still experimenting but it's a bit too much of a hassle for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you do plunge down, you may want to keep the filter just above most of the sunk coffee, that way you can pour it easily but you don't disturb the sediment more than you have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I'm also thinking about filing down the partial thread as it's gotten pretty damaged and is a little gritty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can freeze cold brew. There was a time in my life when I did exactly that. I prepared cold brew in a large batch, then, each day before work, I filled a stainless steel water bottle and stuck that in the freezer overnight. Next day, the bottle would go straight to the fridge at work in the morning, and by lunchtime I'd have drinkable, iced cold brew. Worked great. I did this for about two years and never had an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to take any unusual steps. Use a fully enclosed container to prevent sublimation of water (ice). Any kind of bottle or jar that can safely handle liquid expansion during freezing is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts are neither new nor unheard of. Coffee as a product has always been a luxury item in most parts of the world, so consumers have been creative in finding substitutes for the real deal from the start. They were and still are prepared both at home and sold as commercial products. There are also coffee-and-substitutes mixes, stretching the yield of the coveted real coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades especially cereal coffee made a bit of a comeback in organic food stores in Europe (can’t speak for the US), with multiple major brands throwing one or even multiple blends on the market, and successfully so.  Btw., all that started when kale was still considered a winter vegetable meant to be cooked to a mush and served with bacon or sausages, not a “superfood” to be thrown in a blender raw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common ingredients for coffee substitutes include &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (barley, spelt, rice), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (chicory, dandelion), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (acorns), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (dates) and a bunch of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (molasses). As they typically don’t contain caffeine, they are still used by some consumers that want a coffee-like drink but can’t or don’t want to drink real coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in short, the answer to your main question is: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, it’s quite possible (and in a way even “traditional”) to roast other food items beyond coffee to make a drink appreciated by some consumers.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it would be truly unheard of remains questionable, especially as lots of others have experimented on the topic for centuries - and likely found many raw materials unsuitable for the desired goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend you start reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The scope of this post remains limited to what this site’s scope is - if that’s not sufficient for you, I’m afraid that the question is too broad and more of an invitation for a discussion and less of a clear question in the SE sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I'm not sure what you mean by this because espresso is mostly water. A nice layer of crema can create the perception of a heavy drink, but crema isn't dense. It's all water and gasses. Use freshly roasted beans to get better crema. With light roasts, you want beans that are about 2-4 weeks past roasting if the beans are left whole. Ground coffee will degas much faster than whole bean. Store your coffee in an airtight container with a one-way gas valve (to release pressure that builds up as the coffee releases gasses).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

While chasing the perfect cup, I started experimenting with different ESE pod brands available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I suspect the problem may have to do with your filter basket. There are two types of filter baskets: pressurized and regular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regular filter baskets have many tiny holes through which the espresso drops down after the water has passed through the coffee puck. In this filter baskets, the coffee puck should provide enough resistance for pressure to build.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pressurized filter baskets have a single hole (when looking at the bottom; from the inside it may seem like there's a mesh structure of holes) which builds pressure regardless of the coffee puck. For example, this allows you to brew an espresso with much coarser grinds because the pressure will build because of the basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ESE pods don't provide enough resistance on their own. As such, to use it in a portafilter machine you would need to use a pressurized filter basket. Whole Latte Love has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvlifEL2xBE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a Youtube video showing how to use pods in a Gaggia espresso machine&lt;/a&gt;.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things to consider regarding these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a coffee perspective, it's important to note the difference between caffeine in the bean and caffeine in the coffee drink brewed from those beans. When you extract liquid coffee from grounds you extract some, but not all elements. Caffeine extraction, for example differs based on the brew method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the USDA links in the question show, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171891/nutrients&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;100g of espresso&lt;/a&gt; contains 212mg of caffeine while &lt;a href=&quot;https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171890/nutrients&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;100g of brewed coffee&lt;/a&gt; contains only 40mg of caffeine. That is because espresso is brewed under pressure, which allows more elements to be extracted from the coffee bean using less water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, to make 100g of espresso you would use much more coffee grounds than you would when brewing 100g of brewed coffee. You might be brewing espresso with a brew ratio of 1:2 (15g of grounds to get 30g of liquid espresso) while 1:16 is a good ratio for filter coffee. In that sense, espresso is just more concentrated, with respect to caffeine but it goes for other solubles (particles in the coffee bean which you extract into the coffee liquid) too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should also be said that coffee isn't an exact science. Caffeine content can vary slightly per bean (that's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.org/pages/caffeine-levels-in-coffee-how-much-caffeine-in-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;coffee.org&lt;/a&gt; lists the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; figures). And another variable that may affect caffeine extraction is the brewing process. Just like different brew parameters (temperature, grind size, pressure, etc.) can affect espresso flavor, they might also affect caffeine extraction. I'm not claiming that any of these brew parameters affect caffeine extraction specifically, but they might.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a language perspective, there might be some confusion about the description on &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.org/pages/caffeine-levels-in-coffee-how-much-caffeine-in-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;coffee.org&lt;/a&gt;. They describe caffeine content in the average arabica bean as well as the content per 100g of beans. One bean weighs less than one gram, so it might cause confusion. They provide the following figures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.9mg of caffeine per bean&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.2-1.5g of caffeine per 100g of beans&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking the average of 1.35g of caffeine per 100g of beans, we find there are about 1.35*1000/1.9 = 710 beans in 100 gram of beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;You probably didn't break the machine when adjusting the grind setting when the grinder wasn't in use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this recommendation is that there might be a bean which is stuck between the grind disks. If you try to adjust the grind setting with a bean stuck in between then you might need a lot of force which the adjusting mechanism isn't built for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you try to adjust it and it and everything moves without too much resistance then there is probably no bean stuck in between and adjusting shouldn't harm the machine. If it feels like the knob is stuck when you try to adjust it then it makes sense to turn on the grinder so that the beans blocking the disks will be pulverized as you adjust the setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, adjusting the grind setting with partially ground beans between the burrs can transfer pressure to the adjusting mechanism. Even if that doesn't break the system, it can wear some parts out faster. This reasoning is given &lt;a href=&quot;https://baratza.com/purging-while-adjusting/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;by Baratza&lt;/a&gt; who make burr grinders:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also recommend, when using a Baratza grinder, that you grind coffee through the machine while adjusting your grind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back inside that machine again to better understand why we do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grind size is regulated by the distance between each burr. If you’ve got an empty machine, these burrs can move closer or farther apart unobstructed. When coffee is in the system (especially partially ground coffee retained between the burrs), moving the burrs closer together will press down on that ground coffee. This creates resistance against the burrs which transfers to the adjustment system. The result of this kind of use is a shorter lifespan of the adjustment assembly, leading to more frequent repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;"/>

It's about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vahdamteas.com/blogs/tea-us/is-tea-acidic&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the same as black tea which has pH levels ranging from 4.9 to 5.5&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee acidity may affect dental health because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_erosion&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;acidic foods can erode the teeth&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee is a bit on the border with sources saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dentistryiq.com/dental-hygiene/clinical-hygiene/article/16350765/the-magic-of-ph&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;tooth demineralization may start at a pH of 5.5&lt;/a&gt; (and lower pH means increased acidity).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tannins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin#Drinks_with_tannins&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee contains tannins&lt;/a&gt;, which are a class of chemical compounds. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-and-oral-health/what-does-coffee-do-to-your-teeth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;healthline.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tannins cause color compounds to stick to your teeth.

It only takes one cup of coffee a day to cause stained teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;That depends how the coffee is prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee prepared via the drip method is typically a solution. You can dilute it as much as you like and will never find suspended solids. Coffee prepared in this way generally does not contain the fats and gasses that coffee prepared in other ways would because this method does not use pressurized extraction and because this method uses a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee prepared as espresso through the use of a pressurized system like an espresso machine is all three things: a solution, a suspension, and a colloid. In these machines, paper filters are not used, which allows some of the oil from the beans and some very small fragments of grinds to be captured in the brew, creating a suspension. Also, the force of the pressurized extraction causes gasses in the bean to be extracted into the final brew, creating crema. The crema is a colloid of water, the aforementioned gasses, and the aforementioned fat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other methods will produce varying results depending on the combination of brewing mechanism (pressure, immersion, or percolation) and use of a paper filter vs. metal filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing that the coffee, in those cases where it does come out, is flowing very slowly, just dripping?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your coffee is either too finely ground, or too much. or both, so that the pump struggles to force water through the puck. When you turn of the pump, you're releasing the pressure on the puck, which disturbs it (makes it uneven) so that you get channeling, ie. spots in which the water can flow more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try to grind coarser, and/or use less grinds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you mention it takes 20-30 seconds until the pump gets quieter (which is when the pressure has built up), another posibility is that the pump is broken, or the machine full of limescale.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that decaffeinated coffee is coffee that has had caffeine content removed. To my knowledge, there is no such thing as naturally uncaffinated coffee. Since the coffee starts with caffeine and is sold to you without the caffeine, you can assume (rightly) that decaffeinated coffee undergoes more processing than &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do they do it, then? There are several ways in use today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical rinse. The (green) beans are steamed to heat and wet them, causing slight expansion. The beans are then rinsed with a chemical solvent that dissolves the caffeine. Unfortunately, this process also washes out a good bit of the oils and solid compounds that give coffee its flavor. That solution after flushing then needs to be treated to remove the chemical solvent. The beans are then reintroduced to the remaining solution, and the water is boiled away or allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the compounds that were flushed from the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water bath. The green beans are soaked in water and occasionally agitated for some time. The water dissolves most (but not all) of the caffeine. Then, the beans are removed from the water, and a similar chemical solvent to the chemical rinse method is used to dissolve the caffeine in the water. Finally, the beans are then treated just like the chemical rinse method. The resulting solution is treated to remove the chemical solvent, then the beans are reintroduced to the water for reduction and reapplication of coffee solids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering. This is similar to the water bath method, except instead of using a chemical solvent to remove the caffeine, a filter is used. The solution is passed through a filter repeatedly until measured caffeine content is minimal. This method of course removes some coffee solids also, since filters only discriminate based on molecule size. But caffeine molecules are relatively large, so this method is reasonably affective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide solvent. This method uses carbon dioxide to flush out caffeine by heating and applying high pressure to bring the CO2 to a supercritical state (where it acts as both a liquid and a gas). In this state, the CO2 is force at high pressure through the crevices of heated beans, where it dissolves caffeine (and mostly only caffeine) on contact. The CO2 solution is then purged from the beans and allowed to evaporate away, and the remaining coffee can be collected separately from the beans. Obviously this method is expensive and more technically challenging than the other two methods so isn't in common use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because there are different methods for removing caffeine from coffee and because each method requires a degree of precision to execute completely perfectly, approximation of the flavor of decaffeinated coffee to the flavor of the same, preprocessed coffee varies method to method and even batch to batch. In first two methods, for example, it's hard to ensure even distribution of the dissolved coffee compounds among the decaffeinated beans when reintroducing them. The other methods face similar challenges, except for CO2, which is, as I said above, just plain expensive. All of this means that even though decaffeinated coffee &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; taste mostly like regular coffee, it never will taste &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like regular coffee. And whether it ever comes close enough is hard to say since the processes aren't perfectly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The most important thing for roasting is the heat source. You cannot roast without heat and the type of heat source will influence the result of the roast. For home roasting, I can think of two obvious heat sources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An oven, though this requires some additional material. To use this method you need something to hold the coffee. You'd want the heat to be distributed evenly, but that's quite hard unless you have something so the beans move around while roasting. I've tried home roasting with stainless steel mesh dishes so the heat can move around the beans with the fan providing the most air circulation my oven can handle. Even then the beans don't roast evenly with those at the edge of the tray browning much faster compared to the ones in the center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popcorn machine. The benefits of a popcorn maker are that the beans get agitated and they generally provide enough heat. Downsides of this option are that you have little control, you can only roast small batches and the device may overheat (popcorn takes less time to make than roasting beans).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pan on the stove. The benefits are that you can agitate the beans by stirring and you can control the speed of the roast by dialing the heat. The downsides are that you will have to stir throughout the roast so it all darkens evenly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to use a dedicated home coffee roasting machine, but those tend to be expensive and they're not really everyday tools. Whichever of these methods you use, there will be some or even a lot of smoke production (depending on how dark you roast). So you probably want to think about that as well, maybe by roasting outside or having active ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for how it's done, all methods are pretty much the same. You heat the beans, you provide as much agitation throughout the process so the beans heat evenly. You know when they're done based on visual and audio queues. Per the overview on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting#Roasts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, different roast levels correspond to the beans' internal temperature. As the beans roast they get darker (see the pictures on Wikipedia) and at some stages you will hear a crack. When home roasting, these cracks may continues for a few minutes as the beans don't always roast evenly, just something to keep in mind. See also  &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/3060&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to judge time between cracks when roasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;How to store coffee:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put coffee in an airtight container and freeze it. Thaw only what you will use in the next week. While thawing frozen beans, keep them in an airtight container so moisture doesn’t condense on them. Once up to room temperature, keep them in  an air tight container until use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we perceive as “taste” is really mostly smell. With coffee, this is provided by volatile (means easily evaporated, as opposed to flammable) chemicals. Like alcohols, aldehydes, esters, furans… They evaporate easily, forming equilibrium between their gaseous state and the bound state in the beans.  The higher the temperature, the more these volatiles will favor the gaseous state. If you store coffee in an unsealed container at room temperature (like the hopper of your coffee grinder) these yummy vapors dissipate, leaving the coffee relatively flavorless. If they are in a sealed container, they can’t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of non-volatile chemicals which give coffee its flavor as well (carbohydrates, lipids, organic acids, etc). They are not volatile, so they aren’t going to leave the coffee as vapor. But even if they don’t evaporate, they can oxidize. Oxidation means chemical reaction with oxygen. As a rule, chemical reactions double in speed every 10*C increase in temperature. That’s why coffee flavor is preserved longer in the freezer than at room temperature. You can also reduce oxidation by reducing oxygen. Ideally, a coffee container should be purged with an inert gas like Nitrogen, CO2  or Argon before closing it. But not even I am fanatical enough to bother. Fortunately, commercially packaged coffee bags are self-purging. Coffee off-gasses (mostly CO2) after roasting. That little button on your coffee bag is a vent to let gas out so the bag doesn’t blow up like a balloon. This venting displaces most of the oxygen that was trapped in the bag before it was sealed. That’s why commercially packaged coffee has a reasonable shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My routine:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Buy whole coffee beans in sealed multi-layer bags with a vent button. Never buy coffee from an unsealed bin unless you are buying direct from a roaster. If they can’t tell you the day the beans were roasted, don’t buy them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Immediately freeze any coffee which will not be used within a week.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the multilayer bag is opened, dump the beans into a ZipLoc, expel the air and return to the freezer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thaw beans in a sealed container. Those old fashioned wire-rimmed snap-top glass jars work great.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When grinding, remove only beans you will use immediately and re-seal the container. Don’t keep beans in the grinder hopper. It isn’t air-tight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any Baristas who have been mind-melted by Starbucks will tell you it is bad to freeze coffee. Rubbish. Starbucks doesn’t want to pay for a cold chain or maintain fresh stock, so they store bagged coffee at room temperature for up to 34 weeks, That is over half a year !! &lt;a href=&quot;https://athome.starbucks.com/helping-keep-coffee-fresh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://athome.starbucks.com/helping-keep-coffee-fresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some buzz about grinding frozen beans. The reason for the buzz is that a study showed that grinding REALLY COLD beans (liquid nitrogen temperature, not deep freeze temperature) produces a smaller, more uniform particle size. This may be relevant for industrial grinders, but not at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: grinding frozen beans will produce a finer grind for a given setting on your grinder. If you have found the “perfect setting”, tweak it a bit courser if you are grinding frozen beans. The cold coffee will get some moisture condensation and the coffee will be “clumpy”. You may need to disassemble and clean your grinder more often. I think it’s better to wait for the beans to warm to room temperature before grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Pump espresso machines require a disc type [burr] grinder such as the KRUPS «II Barista» ref 220 or a similar, professional style espresso grinder. This type of grinder will prevent &lt;strong&gt;coffee dust&lt;/strong&gt; which can impede the flow of water through the espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;They seem to think coffee dust wouldn't be a problem for &amp;quot;boiler type espresso machines&amp;quot; (e.g., mokas).&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, blade grinders can be used for mokas, though &amp;quot;coffee dust&amp;quot; may come through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;U̲p̲d̲a̲t̲e̲: I bought a Krups GVX2-12 and noticed it grinds much more homogeneous-sized grains and nothing finer (&amp;quot;coffee dust&amp;quot;); consequently, there aren't over-extraction, bitter issues due to the &amp;quot;coffee dust&amp;quot; of the blade grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

In moka pots you don't want to grind too fine because the device is built for low pressure. If you grind too fine and tamp it really well then the water might not pass through as well at that low pressure. That can cause the brew to take a lot longer or it might trigger the emergency pressure valve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With espresso machines (assuming you're using a regular filter basket, not a pressurized one) you need that finer grind so that pressure can build up.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I think ceramic shouldn't pose any problem in terms of heating. Since the heating element is in the center, sticking in the milk, it shouldn't affect evenness. The material may absorb a significant amount of heat and slow down the steaming process, but that may actually be helpful. It may give you more time to spin the milk and make the nice microfoam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big disadvantage I think is going to be weight. In order to be sturdy and resistant to shattering, the walls have to be pretty thick. So it may put more strain on your wrist and arm and take more effort and energy out of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, IMO the biggest issues with ceramic vs. steel are that the ceramic will cause more &amp;quot;human-factor&amp;quot; problems.

I found only this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not care about the taste of coffee, I am interested only in its health benefits.

It boils faster, but doesn’t get hotter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course you live beside the Dead Sea or in a hyperbaric chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boiling has little effect on the chemical composition of coffee. It has already been exposed to 220C in the roasting process so any chemical bonds fragile enough to react at 100C are long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Health benefits” of coffee are minimal. Coffee drinkers have a slightly lower incidence of bowel cancer. This is likely due to caffeine moving things along in the bowel faster. Caffeine content will not be affected by boiling. Coffee is drunk for yummy taste and caffeine buzz, not for health benefits. Unfortunately, caffeine is classified as a food additive (rather than as a drug) so it can be added to “Energy Drinks” (sugar syrup + caffeine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flavorful components of coffee tend to be extracted early in the process and the bitter components later. That’s why espresso (= “fast” in Italian) has surprisingly little bitterness considering the strength of its flavor. If you are boiling coffee for 20 minutes, I bet it is a bitter brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;One reason could be that your grind is too coarse. Is your coffee pre-ground for french press brewing? Maybe try a different coffee to see if the bean is just not your thing. Your water could also be the problem, if the PH-value is very low (under 7,0).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;These are good hypotheses. These topics depend on personal taste so I'll include personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, let me say that I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0601/8783/6659/files/AreoPress-ENG.pdf?v=1637168529&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;AeroPress manufacturer's (current) instructions&lt;/a&gt; to produce excellent coffee -- tastier and more easily than all the other brewing recipes I've tried, including James Hoffman's. Please do try theirs!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;paper filter&#xA;1 scoop fine drip grind coffee&#xA;1/4 cup 175°F water&#xA;stir 10 seconds&#xA;press&#xA;to taste: add 3/4 cup water for coffee or 3/4 cup milk for latte&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly I do not know why people go to great lengths to do slow brewing, upside down brewing, and other dances. Longer brewing, more water, and/or hotter water are expected to cause bitter &amp;quot;overextraction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Their instructions now say to add water up to (1), which is 1/4 cup. This &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;bypass brewing&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; approach tastes better to me than their older recipe which said to add water to (2) [1/2 cup], and it tastes a LOT better than pushing all the water [1 cup] through the AeroPress.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeropress.com/pages/faq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, they point out that the tawny crema might come out bitter. In my experience, AeroPress hot brew has somewhat bitter crema while the (awesome) AeroPress cold brew recipe has crema that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;So try this: Press the water through the AeroPress, then press the air into the sink and taste the crema that's comes out through the cap. Keep it if and only if you like it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The FAQ also recommends using paper filters because those always won their taste tests over metal filters and they filter out diterpenes which raise your bad cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About your other hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In my limited experimentation, AeroPress is relatively insensitive to grind size and water temperature (because of the immersion method?). I don't find a scale is needed; I just put 1 level scoop of beans in the grinder at a &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; grind level or 1 rounded scoop of beans at a &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; grind size.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Decaf coffee can taste great. Really! But you have to find beans that you like, just like with caffeinated beans except there are fewer choices. I get good results from small roasters, possibly because they take more care to tune the process and timing for each batch. Trader Joe's and Starbucks &amp;quot;reserve blends&amp;quot; have also been OK.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have no experience with LaVazza DEK coffee. The freshness might matter a lot since pre-ground beans are oxidizing faster.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecoffeefolk.com/complete-guide-coffee-grinding/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coffee Folk website has a coffee grind chart&lt;/a&gt; with photos to help explain. They describe &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;slightly finer than table salt&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;most pre-ground coffee&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a consistency similar to sand.&amp;quot; Either is probably good, but go with their &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; size if you can.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can get a grinder and whole beans, that ought to improve the taste a lot. Get a burr grinder. Even an inexpensive one should be OK. There are also hand-operated burr grinders, which are inexpensive, quiet, portable, and better exercise :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'd really expect pre-ground coffee to have a consistent grinding size. If it looks evenly ground, that's good enough. In contrast, a blade grinder produces widely inconsistent grinds ranging from dust size to whole beans that didn't get cut at all.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In my experience, decaf does not to be brewed any differently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; You can keep beans (esp. ground beans) fresh longer in a vacuum-sealed container such as a Zwilling &amp;quot;Fresh &amp;amp; Save&amp;quot; bag. An AirScape canister also works but it's bulkier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So packing coffee gear for a trip means: AeroPress Go, Zwilling vacuum pump and bag, pre-ground beans (or buy the beans while traveling).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I have no material relationship with these companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;When I brew espresso, I often get &amp;quot;bald&amp;quot; spots where no espresso is running through the some parts of the filter basket. Or in other words, I can see the filter basket screen whilst brewing coffee. I reckon this ins't the right terminology so here's a picture of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yz5BN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yz5BN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the &amp;quot;bald&amp;quot; spots whilst brewing espresso&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My setup is a Lelit Bianca with a VST basket and one of these &amp;quot;nanotech&amp;quot; shower screens. I grind with a Baratza Sette 270wi but I single dose the coffee (i.e. I'm not using the built-in weighing function of that grinder). The coffee is fresh (~7 days from roasting) specialty coffee, light to medium roast. The pump pressure is set to ~9 bars and for the sake of fixing this issue I'm not using the pressure profiling functionality of the Bianca. It's full stream for 5 secs (pre-infusion), then off for 4 secs and then on again to brew the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put 18 grams of coffee in and I'm aiming for ~38g of coffee out in 25 seconds after the first drop of espresso lands in the cup. With the pre-infusion that means the Bianca's shot timer will show something like 34 seconds (9 sec of pre-infusion -- 5 on, 4 off) + 25 sec for the actual brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I carefully prepare my freshly ground coffee with some WDT and a tamp. To me, my puck prep is looking okay because can see that the first bits of coffee show up more or less evenly all across the basket. Here's a picture of what it usually looks like on the first drop&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tbMK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tbMK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the first drop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the first drops fall into the cup everything starts to look nice for maybe 5 seconds but then the &amp;quot;bald spots&amp;quot; start appearing. Here's a picture of what I think is looking nicely&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/uy45S.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/uy45S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to depend a little bit on the coffee I use. Sometimes it happens more and with other coffees it happens a bit less. But there's always the tendency (or with some coffees every single shot) for the bald spots to appear pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some things that don't seem to matter much here are grinding either finer or coarser: As you'd expect that greatly affects how fast the espresso is running through but the bald spots don't disappear. Also reducing the pressure or trying different kinds of flow profiles also don't seem to really affect it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the wet puck usually looks okay, there are no obvious signs of bad channeling at least to me. Here some pictures of the spent pucks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Erzmj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Erzmj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the wet puck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m1Xta.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m1Xta.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the knocked-out puck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't see anything obviously wrong here but I might be missing something.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have just bought a 6-cup Bialetti Moka Express, and the user manual quotes its 300 ml reservoir should result in 270 ml of coffee.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;However, I have conducted some tests, and unless the grind size is around kosher salt, I am unable to get more than 100 ml out of it. I control the heat to have a stable flow. When the bubbles start I remove the heat and cool the pot down with cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does extracting so little coffee when compared to the manual quoted figure an indication anything is wrong?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If so, could you point where the problem might be coming from?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm experiencing parosmia (unusual or phantom tastes and smells) which is making some (but not all) foods and drinks very unpleasant tasting.

The intent is to reduce inflammation such as arthritis. The black pepper is supposed to make it more effective and it adds to the taste. Sometimes I open my daily capsule and pour it into coffee. The result is kind of gritty but tasty. You can also get turmeric powder in bulk, and that might be ground finer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please report back on your discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Blade grinder vs. single mug?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;For &amp;quot;utility&amp;quot; coffee drinking, I &lt;strong&gt;temporarily&lt;/strong&gt; need to grind coffee with something as inexpensive as possible, and would prefer something with a motor.  My understanding is that fresh beans ground with a blade grinder at brewing time will still be significantly better than old ground coffee.  So I'm looking at inexpensive blade grinders, and have a question about blade design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On some models, the blades sit fairly high off the base of the grinding cup (these are sold as coffee grinders, not general purpose grinders).  They are advertised as handling enough beans for 10-12 cups.  With that amount of coffee, the grounds will push each other around and mix in the cup.  However, I'd be grinding just a couple of coffee measures at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of pictures from the product information for one such grinder (Proctor Silex 80402):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XAP9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XAP9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHv5F.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHv5F.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B09C2FPQXQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first picture, you can see the large gap below the blades.  The second picture shows some small amount of ground beans sitting completely below the blades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like for a small amount of coffee, the beans would quickly break up into chunks small enough to drop below the blades.  Then they would pretty much just sit there and not get ground finer as the blades spun above them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if people here have experienced that problem with blade grinders of a similar design, or would even a couple of measures of coffee be enough to go well over the top of the blades, so the grounds do mix and circulate?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anyone doesn't want to admit on the site to using a blade grinder, feel free to preface any answers with &amp;quot;I read somewhere...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Long, long ago before I knew anything about coffee...&amp;quot;.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It took some experimentation to work well, and even then it was still a cheap grinder, but it'll get the job done for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are differences in acidity in different varieties of coffee, and you can choose a variety that is more acidic (more acidic coffees will often have their flavors described with terms that suggest brightness or fresh fruit).  Roasting also breaks down some of the acidic components, so the darker the roast, the less acidic it will be.  Try a light to medium roast for more acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, what you describe as related to brewing method probably isn't really tied to brewing method, but rather grind and extraction time.  The acidic flavors are the easiest to dissolve, so they are the first flavors extracted, regardless of brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With espresso, you use a very fine grind and extract for a very short time.  With French press, you use a coarse grind and extract for a long time.  Given any combination of grind and water temperature, the flavors extracted will vary over time.  The acidic flavors mostly extract relatively early.  Then flavors that give it sweetness and body.  The bitter flavors are the least soluable, so they are the ones extracted latest in the process.  You can also minimize bitter flavors with low water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to recognize that the apparent flavor is affected by the balance of the different flavor components.  If you stop the extraction early, the acidic flavors will be over-represented.  As the brew progresses, other flavors become more noticeable, so the acidic flavors are less noticeable in comparison.  If the brew has plenty of body and flavor, and is noticeably acidic, that probably reflects the bean variety and roasting (or an excessive amount of coffee with a short extraction time).  If the taste is thin and empty but noticeably acidic, that points to it being under-extracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With espresso, time and temperature are controlled, and grind needs to be within a narrow range for the process to work.  With a French press, you can control all the variables.  If you want a more acidic result, start with lower temperature water (try 175°-185°F), and brew for a shorter time.  If the flavor is good but weak, use more coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It will be close to four times as strong.  I say &amp;quot;close to&amp;quot; because the amount of coffee can influence some other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long the water is in contact with the grounds affects the strength.  Depending on the brew method, a significantly deeper bed of grounds can slow down how fast water passes through (if water takes longer to get through, it will be stronger).  The finer the grind, the more the effect.  The biggest impact would probably be with a cone-shaped filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're grinding it yourself rather than using coffee pre-ground for a filter brewer (standard grind for store-bought ground coffee), using too fine a grind can slow down the water so much that the filter basket can overflow (and you can get weaker coffee because much of the water bypasses the grounds).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that if you increase the brew time significantly, the finished coffee can have a different flavor profile (generally not as good).  The coffee can get over-extracted, in which case flavor compounds that tend to be more bitter and sour become more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grounds retain some of the water, roughly 2 grams of water for every gram of coffee (a paper filter also retains some water).  If you measure using a coffee scoop, coffee makers typically come with a 1 tablespoon size scoop, which will hold somewhere around 5 to 7.5 grams of coffee depending on the coffee, grind size, and whether you level the scoop or use a rounded scoop.  So every 2-3 scoops of coffee with retain about 1 fl oz of water.  If I brew a 12 oz mug of coffee, I need to start with about 14 oz of water to get 12 oz of coffee out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you start with enough grounds for four cups of coffee and brew just one cup, the coffee will retain a significant amount of water relative to your serving.  The relationship between the coffee:water ratio and extraction is based on all the water and all the coffee rather than the water in the brew that ends up in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you need to include the retained water when figuring the effect on brew strength.  Enough grounds for four 6 oz cups (the serving size drip coffee makers are based on), at standard strength, will retain roughly 3 oz of water.  So if you don't account for the retained water, you'd end up with a serving of about 3 oz.  You would need to start with water at the 1 1/2 cup level to end up with a one cup serving.  If you were making four cups, the volume loss from retained water wouldn't be that noticeable since cups normally aren't filled to the brim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strength of what is added to the brew does vary from the beginning to the end of the extraction, but that shouldn't be a significant factor in brew strength for the batch in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The bottom right &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu user&lt;/em&gt; looks like a coffee pad machine using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Serving_Espresso_Pod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Easy Server Espresso pods&lt;/a&gt;. I say this because it has the rounded bit above the cup which is where the coffee pad seems to go. Such machines work by inserting a paper pad containing ground coffee. The machine then pushes water through resulting in a cup of coffee. This requires the least effort because the pods can be bought in the store, there's no need to dose yourself and it doesn't need much cleanup after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The top left &lt;em&gt;Debian user&lt;/em&gt; is electric filter brewer or drip brewer. In the rounded part above the pot goes a paper or metal filter in which the user adds ground coffee. There's another compartment for water and turning on the machine heats the water brews the coffee into the pot. These kinds of machines often have a heating pad below the pod to keep the coffee hot, though some machines brew into a thermos pot without additional heating instead. This kind of pot is more useful for larger batches; it does require the user to dose the amount of coffee and it's a bit more cleanup (renewing the paper filter or cleaning out the metal filter).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom left (&lt;em&gt;Arch&lt;/em&gt;) and bottom middle (&lt;em&gt;Fedora&lt;/em&gt;) look like V60 (&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/v60&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;v60&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;v60&lt;/a&gt;) and Chemex (&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/chemex&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;chemex&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;chemex&lt;/a&gt;) brewers, respectively. They are also filter brewers like Debian one except that they require the user to pour over the water manually. This gives some more control over the brewing process, for example by allowing a longer &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/337&quot;&gt;bloom&lt;/a&gt;. It may take less countertop space because these brewers are small enough to store in most cupboards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom middle &lt;em&gt;Fedora user&lt;/em&gt; could also be a cloth filter brewer (they didn't draw the filter). In that case a piece of cloth is used instead of a one-time paper or reusable metal filter. This kind of brewing takes even more time because the cloth filter should be rinsed after each use and stored in a way that no mildew develops in the damp cloth. It's too much to go into here, but James Hoffman has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_I3ZVKKb4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;good video on cloth filter brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the top right &lt;em&gt;Gentoo user&lt;/em&gt; shows an espresso machine. This brewing method requires a finer grind of coffee which is tamped into a puck in a portafilter. The machine then pushes high pressure water through the puck to get a concentrated shot of coffee: espresso. Of the methods shown, this gives the user the most customization in terms of brew temperature, brew pressure, grind size, and extraction ratio (how much water to push through before stopping the brew). These aspects may be customized in some of the previous brewing methods too, but they'd have less influence because they use larger grind sizes. Dialing in these parameters can take a few shots (e.g. when changing beans) and each turn tempts one to taste before adjusting the parameters further. As such, I would not really recommend it for one trying to lower their coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the goal of reducing coffee consumption, I'd lean toward the cloth filter brewing method. As it takes some extra time to clean up by rinsing the filter and storing it properly (submerged in clean water in the fridge) in addition to the manually pouring hot water over the grounds, I consider it quite a bit of effort for a simple cup. Before choosing this option though, I'd recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_I3ZVKKb4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;James Hoffman's video on cloth filters&lt;/a&gt; which paints a picture of how involved / rewarding it can be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two other brewing methods I feel are worth mentioning: the moka pot and the French press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;moka pot&lt;/a&gt; is a metal stove-top brewer. At the bottom is the water chamber with a funnel to the coffee ground compartment above it. When the water is heated on the stove, the water pushes up through the coffee and into the top chamber where the brewed coffee goes. It's a bit like espresso though the brewing pressure is much lower. These pots come in different sizes. The brewer needs to be taken apart after each use to take out the used coffee, rinse everything off and fill the water and coffee compartments again. I'd say the moka pot is comparable to the cloth filter in terms of effort though it's a bit more forgiving because it doesn't have the mildew issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;French press&lt;/a&gt; is a different brewer to the ones we've seen before. It's an immersion brew in which the ground coffee and the water sit together for about 5 minutes after which a metal filter is used to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee. It's a bit less involved than the moka pot and cloth filter but it still requires cleanup (removing the wet ground from the brew chamber and rinsing everything off) before a new cup can be brewed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there have been wild claims about various (or most) coffee packagers adding MSG to either their coffee or the packaging, supposedly to make their product more addicting or at least more popular.  People react negatively to such claims for many obvious reasons -- they've heard that MSG is harmful, they don't want adulterated coffee, they don't want to be duped or manipulated, etc. There has never been any actual evidence that any coffee packager actually did this, and lab tests disproved the claims when specific coffee companies were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some retailers now put &amp;quot;No MSG&amp;quot; notices on their coffee offerings for the same BS marketing reasons they put &amp;quot;gluten free&amp;quot; on products that never contained gluten.  So to the extent people are aware of the disinformation campaigns or see the &amp;quot;No MSG&amp;quot; notices, they are likely to frown on it as someone adulterating their food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect the negative reaction to hearing that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; do it is either the same generalized reaction (if it's bad for coffee packagers to do it, why would you do it yourself?), or the fact that it's an unusual substance to add to coffee.  For example, some people are aware that adding a small amount of salt to coffee can enhance the taste (if you like that); the people who aren't aware of it often consider it strange when they hear about it.  And adding MSG is far more unusual.  Some people are adventurous, and anxious to try new things.  Others cringe at the idea of things that sound unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may have jumped to a conclusion that there must, or could, be a good reason not to add MSG to coffee based on the often negative reaction people have to the idea.  The negative attitude can be explained, but I'm not aware of factual or compelling supporting reasons not to do it (other than the person believing that small amounts of MSG are harmful).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;When you brew coffee, the grounds retain some of the water (roughly 2g of water for every 1g of coffee).

And the amount of ground coffee required will be based on the amount of water in the finished serving plus the amount of water that will be retained in those grounds, which will be based on the amount of grounds you're trying to determine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do you figure out the required weight of coffee to produce the desired finished serving size?

When brewing with the bialetti, one uses boiling hot water which is in contact with the grounds for much longer than most brewing methods. The general rules for adjusting overextracted coffee apply: grind coarser, lower temperature (impossible with a Bialetti), reduce brewing time. The brewing time can be slightly reduced by preheating the Bialetti and using already boiling water when pouring it inside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDLoIvb0w4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; by James Hoffmann, explaining what one can do to get a palatable cup of coffee out of the Bialetti moka pot.

There is also special equipment, like sieves, that will separate the particles into size ranges, and visual guides you can compare the grounds against.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;If you own an AeroPress, there's an easy way to do it.  I discovered this in the process of making coffee stain from spent grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grounds settle to the bottom of the brew by size; the bigger the particle, the faster it settles to the bottom.  However, in the initial brewing, it isn't a clean separation because gas released by the grounds buoys some of the grounds.  That doesn't happen if you repeat the process with spent grounds (you wouldn't want to drink the result, but you can still extract a lot of color to make stain).  Here's a process to see the particle size distribution:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After brewing the coffee, capture all of the spent grounds.  The cake can be knocked off into a container, but some will stick to the filter and plunger.  Rinse those with a little water into the same container.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add some water to the container, enough so the grounds can be well stirred into the water, so it isn't like a paste.  When I make coffee stain, I microwave this mixture to cook more of the color out of the grounds, which may leave them more water-logged.  You can try this with ot without microwaving to see if that makes a difference in the particle separation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare the AeroPress for upright brewing (you can rinse and reuse the original filter for this purpose or use a fresh one).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir and pour the water/grounds mix into the AeroPress, scraping the container to get all of the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If necessary, add some more water to the AeroPress so there's plenty for disbursing the grounds.  Stir the mixture well and aggressively to get all of the grounds suspended in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insert the plunger at an angle to get it into the body without compressing the air.  That will seal the end and keep the water from draining out while the grounds settle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the AeroPress sit for at least several minutes so the grounds settle to the bottom (5 minutes should be plenty).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a slow press all the way down, even compressing the cake a little, which will help it stay together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the strainer cap, and carefully remove the filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coarsest particles will be on the filter and at that end of the cake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push the plunger all the way in to expose the cake, and knock it off onto something like a plate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fines are likely to act like glue and keep a thin layer of grounds stuck to the plunger.  Compare the exposed (non-fines) grounds stuck on the plunger or at that end of the cake to the grounds at the filter-end of the cake.  The size difference will show you the range of sizes the grinder is producing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully scrape the plunger onto the plate to push everything off as one intact piece.  What comes off will be a little like clay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is normally a gap in size between what the grinder is grinding and the fines (the fines are mostly dust that breaks off the beans when the beans are distorted during grinding; the grinder doesn't grind fines).  There will always be some amount of fines.  If the grinder is doing mostly cutting rather than crushing, the layer of fines will be a very small portion of the thickness of the cake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main usefulness of this technique is to see the size range that the grinder is producing.  You can theoretically treat the cake like a soil or ice core.  After you've compared the ends for particle size, you can shave off layers of the cake with a knife to get an idea of the amount of grounds at different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that's of limited usefulness.  Particles anywhere close to a medium grind settle out pretty fast.  Fine or very fine particles take a little longer.  In the race to the bottom, you get a distribution of particles that changes over time.  So there will be a thin layer at the filter end that is predominantly the largest particles, and a thin layer at the plunger end that will be predominantly the smallest particles.  In between will be a mix of sizes, the average of which will get smaller as you move through the cake.  Trying to judge particle size in the intermediate layers of the cake isn't a whole lot easier than judging it by spreading out the fresh grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With my own grinder, I set the size to a little finer than the size of standard pre-ground coffee for drip coffee makers.  The coarsest grounds my grinder produces are roughly like pre-ground coffee, and the finest are about what I set the grinder for.  Looking at the grinds as they come out of the grinder, it's hard to distinguish size differences in the pile, and it looks like it's all what I set the grinder for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I checked if the pores of the filter are blocked, but that is also not the case. They are all clearly opened. I wash it regularly. I tried using and not using the middle pressing instrument. No effect on the result. So I don't know what's exactly wrong and why this sudden change has happened. One thing that is different is that I have stored the coffee powder for a longer while this time (still not more than half a month). Can it make a difference? Does the powder have a shelf-life?

Microwave ovens are very efficient since nearly all the energy goes into heating the water and (indirectly) the cup holding the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a &lt;strong&gt;Moka pot&lt;/strong&gt; requires heating the entire pot and its contents over a stove, so a significant fraction of the heat energy goes into the stovetop, pot, and air. Worse, when using a gas stove, it will emit CO₂, unhealthy combustion products, and also some methane when starting and stopping the flame. (Use a hood fan to exhaust most of these gasses.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;automatic coffee machine&lt;/strong&gt; has to heat the water and its internal components to the desired temperature, most likely using a resistive electric heater. Even worse if it's in a standby mode that holds the water hot for a long time. I bet energy efficiency is not high on the designers' priority list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even better: With an &lt;strong&gt;AeroPress&lt;/strong&gt; you heat just the amount of water needed and heat it to a lower temperature than other brewers. Per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeropress.com/pages/science&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;manufacturer's recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, 175°F (80°C) or 185°F (85°C). (Or start there and experiment with the brewing temperature to taste.) I set an 1100 watt microwave oven for ≈93 seconds, then stir the water (since the heat rises in the cup). (When I'm really picky, I use a thermometer to wait for it to cool to 175°F.) For the best taste, use &amp;quot;bypass brewing,&amp;quot; that is, put 1/4 of the water through the press, stir for 10 seconds, then add rest of the water to the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best: Use the &lt;strong&gt;AeroPress&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeropress.com/pages/cold-brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;cold brew&amp;quot; recipe&lt;/a&gt; which skips the heating entirely.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The barista was describing the physical action of extraction rather than a specific procedure.  The coffee-making procedures are designed to produce the right amount of extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The living coffee beans contain cells of plant material within a cellulose structure.  When the beans are roasted, the water is driven out and the heat cooks the beans.  You get a &amp;quot;woody&amp;quot; cellulose nugget with all the different organic compounds still integrated and trapped within it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 30% of the coffee bean is stuff that is soluable to one degree or another.  Stuff that is highly soluble goes into solution first during the brewing process.  The less soluble the compound is, the longer it takes to go into solution.  The compounds fall into general categories, like acids, sugars, fats, etc.  Compounds in the different categories tend to have similar solubility and generally similar kinds of flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So early in the extraction, good-flavored acids go into solution (think of the acids in fruit) and predominate the flavors being extracted.  Then sugars predominate the flavors being extracted, etc.  As the extraction progresses, you get more of the flavors that make up the taste profile of coffee, and the flavor becomes fuller and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you continue to extract beyond the point where good flavors predominate, you start extracting more noticeable amounts of compounds that don't taste good (generally bitter and sour, but not in a good way).  The barista mentions tannins, which are bitter and extracted later in the process because they're less soluble than some of the other compounds.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://handground.com/grind/an-intuitive-guide-to-coffee-solubles-extraction-and-tds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;An Intuitive Guide To Coffee Solubles, Extraction And TDS&lt;/a&gt; has a good description of all this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the idea is not to extract every last bit of soluable material, only the compounds that add pleasant flavors (roughly 20% of what's in the bean).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting the compounds into solution is affected by how finely the beans are ground (the finer the grind, the less time it takes the water to soak into the woody material to dissolve the soluble stuff), the water temperature (the hotter the water, the faster compounds go into solution; lower brewing temperature stretches the extraction time to more easily control the stopping point), brewing time, and some other variables, like agitation and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many different methods to brew coffee, from espresso, where the extraction happens in roughly half a minute, to cold brew, where extraction takes a major fraction of a day.  But within any method, the flavor profile builds in the same sequence.  The art and science of coffee making focuses on controlling the variables to get the good flavors extracted, and then to stop the extraction before the flavor is overwhelmed by bad flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's what the barista was describing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a number of considerations, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What happens in absolute terms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What happens relative to your own sense of taste and smell.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nature and usage of the air tight container.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two actions are the big contributors to coffee losing its flavor: loss of aromatics through evaporation and oxidation.  These happen quickly on the surface and take longer in the interior of the beans or grinds.  The finer the grind, the faster it loses flavor, both because there's more surface area and the interior is closer to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So coarse grind for cold brew will take longer to noticeably deteriorate than medium grind for drip coffee makers, and whole beans will take longer than coarse grind.  Grinding the beans shortly before you're ready to use them will preserve the most flavor and minimize off-tastes from oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal differences in taste and smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that's what happens to the coffee, but different people are more or less sensitive to it.  Connoisseurs may taste the difference in ground coffee that's been exposed to air for a number of hours.  People with cast iron palates who drink utility coffee may not notice the degradation until the coffee is very old.  People also start to lose some of their sense of taste and smell as they get older, and may be less sensitive to the difference in taste of old coffee.  So it isn't so much a question of how much the flavor has degraded in ways you would measure in a lab, its how much degradation does it take for you to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're serving coffee to guests and you're a connoisseur and they're utility coffee drinkers, the nuances that give you great pleasure may be totally lost on them.  If you're the one with a cast iron palate and your guests can appreciate good coffee, old coffee that tastes fine to you may leave your guests wondering how you get it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air tight containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storing the coffee in an air tight container may slow the degradation, but not all air tight containers or methods of using them will do so.  If the coffee is sealed in a close-fitting or vacuum evacuated, air tight container that stays sealed, it can last for a reasonably long time.  But if the container contains a lot of air space, and/or you regularly open it to dispense coffee, the fact that the container may be air tight doesn't buy you much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the container is a pouch with a one-way valve so you can squeeze out the air when you reseal it, it will last longer than a can or canister with a tight-fitting lid.  Every time you open the container, some of the aromatics escape, and you introduce air.  With a can or canister, that fresh air oxidizes the coffee during storage after you reseal the container.  If you have a vacuum canister that gets pumped out by a vacuum sealer, you minimize the oxidation but still lose some aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage time recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The storage times recommended by coffee packagers varies by the market audience for the coffee.  Specialty coffees whose market is discriminating drinkers are likely to carry a &amp;quot;best-by&amp;quot; date of around 6 months for the sealed package.  On mass-market coffee, that's typically pushed to more like a year.  But those recomendations are for the still-sealed container.  Once you open it, the shelf life is much shorter.  When you first open year-old coffee, you'll get the aroma that was trapped in the container, but the flavor will quickly degrade.  Ground coffee will taste stale to many people within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how long you can keep coffee without it losing flavor depends on how fresh it is.  Freshly roasted coffee needs to age a little if you get it directly from a roaster, but otherwise, the fresher it is, the longer it will last.  Start by buying coffee as close as possible to when it was roasted.  You can contact the coffee company and ask how many months the use-by date on the package is from the roasting date.  For the longest shelf life, try to buy coffee as much under 6 months old as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For relatively fresh whole beans stored in a vacuum canister after opening the retail package, I've seen recommendations that the average coffee drinker can taste the difference after 6-8 weeks.  Other recommendations say many people can taste the difference after 2-3 weeks.  If you leave the beans in a retail pouch with a one-way valve and keep the air squeezed out, I've seen recommendations of 2-3 weeks shelf life before the average coffee drinker will notice the difference.  For a non-air-tight container, the recommendations are even shorter.  And all of those time frames are shorter for ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the recommendations apply to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if it is just you drinking it, go by what you can taste.  My wife opens a year-old, giant canister of mass-market ground coffee, and spends many months working her way through it.  By the time the canister is half full, the only aroma is of very stale coffee.  By the time she gets to the bottom of the canister, it smells like medicine.  But it tastes fine to her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I've had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lapavoni.com/en/product/professional-lusso-wooden-handles/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lapavoni coffee machine&lt;/a&gt; for 2 years, but I can't get my espresso right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is quite simple: when I lift the handle to make the water flow, the water flows straight out. I think the problem is the size of my tamper which is 51mm whereas the portafilter is 51.5mm or maybe 51.6mm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I buy a tamper like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bplus.biz/products/516mm-tamper&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for example, will my problem be solved?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Lapavoni  ! I love mine !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time it takes for water to percolate through the portafilter on tank pressure alone is the best measure of your grind/tamp combination. I shoot for 4 to 6 seconds. Then I let it drip (?pre-infuse?) for 10 seconds before pulling down the lever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If water goes through too fast, make the grind finer or tamp harder. If water takes too long, make the grind courser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a continuum of grind/tamp combinations that can give the 4-6 second effect. But too of a course grind with really hard tamp gives weak extraction. Also, you get very little crema.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with your 51mm diameter tamper. My tamper is 51.7mm, with only a few ‘thou clearance. I made it on a metal lathe for a custom fit. But even a small bit of grounds on the edge and it jams. I need to wipe the edge every time I use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know many caffeine-heads poo-poo tamping scales. But you cannot get consistent performance without it. It doesn’t matter how hard you tamp, but it must be consistent. You can jerry-rig a scale. Get a wooden ruler and put a pink pencil eraser under each end. Put your portafilter half way and tamp until the ruler bends enough to touch the counter. If you want a harder tamp, move the erasers a bit closer together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another hint: The brew head is a big chunk of metal which will cool the water and under-extract if the head is not pre-heated. Run a full shot of water through the head to pre-heat before pulling the first shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's probably safe.  I can give you a theoretical answer.  Someone who has repeatedly done it could add anecdotal evidence that theirs hasn't broken yet (or refute the idea if they tried it and it broke).  Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question focuses on the glass, so I'll start with that.  Borosilicate glass has a very low coeficient of thermal expansion, making it very tolerant of high temperatures, rapid changes in temperature, and temperature differences within an item.  All borosilicate glass generally has that characteristic, but the exact composition and manufacturing process varies, and not all borosilicate glass is the same.  Some products could handle more extreme situations than others.  But it's likely that any borosilicate glass from a reputable manufacturer could handle the temperatures and conditions encountered in food and beverage preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some context, the original Pyrex formulation was a type of borosilicate glass patented by Corning.  It could be heated on the stove top or a hot plate, or go from refrigerator to oven without breaking.  Some Pyrex products are still made with borosilicate glass, but the kitchenware now generally is not.  It was changed to tempered soda-lime glass because that's much cheaper to make, and that is usually adequate for most household food and beverage preparation requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tempered soda-lime glass will handle oven temperatures, but not large, rapid temperature changes or differences within an item.  For example, it can't be used on a stove top or have direct contact with the heating element.  Laboratories that use glassware that will be heated generally stick with borosilicate glass because it is more tolerant of temperature-related issues than tempered soda-lime glass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A disreputable manufacturer could make crappy borosilicate glass, which didn't have the thermal stability you would expect.  Bodum is a reputable brand, and likely would not use substandard glass.  This item was designed for a different usage.  It sounds like the company has not specifically tested it on a hot plate, so they don't want to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But all that said, I suspect the issue with the stove-top use warning is not the glass, but the collar, which looks like it's made of cork and leather (and the plastic filter above that).  Those could be susceptible to damage from an open flame on a gas stove, or intense heat from an over-sized electric burner.  But if the bottom of the carafe is properly sized and on a drip coffee maker heating pad, that issue wouldn't be relevant.  It ought to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently started trying to make my own coffee instead of just buying them in bottles or somewhere else, and I found ground pumpkin spice at Walmart. I decided to try it, but since I don’t really know what I’m doing, it is coming out absolutely not right.

What’s the best way to try and make it taste more like the real deal? I’m sure adding milk is a part of it, but I’m not sure how/where/when to add it or if I just need creamer or something.

I'm trying to make it iced, as the machine has iced as an option (although it still brews with hot water so I don't think it would interfere that much with how it comes out). Also, I'm not sure what brew method it's sold for as asked by fixer, because the only directions the coffee actually has is just 1) use 1 and a half tablespoons of coffee and 2) add 6 fluid ounces of cold filtered water. But the only videos I've seen of people making this use hot water?? As a side note, I just went ahead and tried making it the hot option instead of the iced option on the maker, and it came out darker, but it still tasted super bitter, although I'm not sure whether to follow the coffee machine's instructions or whats on the bag with the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quick edit - Right after I made the hot coffee I tried icing it and adding creamer. It looked a whole lot more like the real starbucks version, but it didn't really taste like too much. I didn't add all that much creamer, only 5 teaspoons for a relatively big(ish) glass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

She says it makes it more bitter, and you should either wait for the espresso to cool a little or mix it with the milk first to bring its temperature down before adding the ice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did a little experiment by making two iced lattes, one with hot espresso and one with room-temperature espresso I had made an hour before and left out to cool.

However, I have never heard a term as &lt;em&gt;shocking the espresso&lt;/em&gt;. Fundamentally, Japanese brewing is applied to keep more fruity flavors (if there exist any) intact by not letting them evaporate right after pulling the shot. Therefore, based on this explanation, it should smell less but taste a bit more fruity. One should not expect a bitter taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final word, I would like to add a speculation. This is not based on observation but pure reasoning: If the roast is dark, very probably you already lost the fruity flavors and ice might help to keep the burnt flavor a bit more. So, the final result could be bitter maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If you're just starting out, he provides a common-sense explanation and method for basic coffee tasting that strips out a lot of the complexities used in professional or commercial tasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gist of cupping is that it uses a simple brewing method that isn't influenced by the person's technique.  Standardized conditions ensure that everything is brewed the same, in a way that produces properly-extracted coffee of normal-strength.  The brewing method is similar to French press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It adds the tasting method of slurping the coffee from a spoon.  That removes more potential variation.  Each sample is a uniform amount.  The slurping action sprays the coffee around the inside of your mouth to stimulate the different taste and smell sensors in a uniform way that enhances your ability to experience the flavor and aroma components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee cupping has a home use in addition to comparing coffees or developing your ability to differentiate flavors.  If you're just getting into exploring brewing methods and &amp;quot;recipes&amp;quot;, it's easy for the experiments to produce brews that don't taste like what you expect.  After a few of those, you start asking yourself, &amp;quot;what is this coffee supposed to taste like when it's properly brewed?&amp;quot;  Cupping it will give you a good flavor baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;My first read of your title was literal, and I thought, &amp;quot;Sure, you can probably reheat coffee and make it taste like dirty porcelain.&amp;quot;  :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of things can change the taste.  Just sitting out, volatile components that contribute to the aroma evaporate.  Any form of heating speeds that up.  Aroma contributes a lot to the taste.  So this affects the flavor profile, generally in the direction of less-tasty, and with much less of the familiar coffee aroma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you also get some evaporation of the water, which makes the less-tasty coffee a little more concentrated, so that much more noticeable.  Again, there's some evaporation just sitting out, and heating speeds it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you overheat it to near boiling, either the whole cup in a microwave and then let it cool to drinking temperature, or heat it on a stove and the bottom is what gets very hot, you can scorch it and produce off flavors.  I'm not sure if the jury is in on whether heat near boiling also breaks down some of the flavor compounds in the extracted coffee, which would affect the taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need to reheat, avoid doing it on the stove.  If you do it in a microwave, don't heat it more than necessary (two minutes is a lot of time for one cup of liquid unless you have a low-power microwave; better to do it in shorter increments and check it to avoid overheating).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best solution is to get a good thermos and keep the hot coffee in that.  You may not need to reheat it.  But if you do, you will likely need to raise the temperature only a small amount.  Whether that tastes like the first cup will depend on how discerning your palate is, but it will be a lot closer to the taste of the first cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another approach requires a little more time, but it gets you a &amp;quot;first cup&amp;quot; every time.  That is to brew one cup's worth at a time.  With pour-over, that would add a lot of time (OTOH, it might serve as a good excuse to procrastinate something).  If you use a small French press or just put in one serving worth of coffee and water, it would add only rinsing time and heating some water after the first brew in terms of work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Aeropress is designed as a single-serving brewer.  You can use it like a French press or brew a serving quickly, and it can be rinsed out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a time saver, if you consume the second cup within the same eight-hour workday as the first cup, most people wouldn't taste the difference if the coffee for both servings is ground at one time and what's needed for the second serving is kept in a small air-tight container until use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If there was a big difference in particle size, the small particles would be over-extracted by the time the big particles get well-extracted, or the big particles would get under-extracted by stopping when the small particles are properly extracted.  And the brew ends up a mix of extraction levels rather than a targeted level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference is because it takes time for water to soak into the interior of the particles and leach out the solubles.  The farther the center of the particle is from the surface, the longer it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A coarse grind is a different configuration of the same issue.  Water needs to go through the bean material near the surface to get to the bean material at the center.  So you have the same action as large and small particles, only within the same particle.  Bean material near the surface will get over-extracted in the process of extracting from bean material in the center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a small particle size, the bean material in the center isn't far from the surface.  So extraction should be very uniform within the particle as well as between particles.  And with a small particle size, extraction time is much faster.  That doesn't preclude any brewing methods, like French press; you would just brew for a shorter time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it is so important to start with a uniform grind size, why would a coarse grind ever be desirable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;A uniform coarse grind makes it is easy to filter, which means you can use simpler filtration and still avoid having fine bean particles in your final brew.  A fine grind french press would taste terrible if you use most pots because they do not filter out enough of the particles from the final brew you drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is much less precision required in terms of time, because a coarse ground soaked for a longer period of time has a wider margin of error compared to the margin of mere seconds when using a finer grind.  Possibly due to oxidation becoming a factor during longer brews.  Even if your French Press had a great filter to address the filtration, you would find yourself having to have a very narrow range of timing to ensure it is not over-extracted or under-extracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It isn't so much the &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; of the time spent up to that point, as it is various things are ongoing and at a somewhat arbitrary point you break up the crust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Why 4 minutes? What would happen with much shorter or much longer times?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within reason, it wouldn't make much difference, at least that you would likely be able to tell.  For cupping purposes, the more important aspect is that the procedure be consistent.  It needs to happen at some point, and a time in the ballpark of 4 minutes is a good compromise to get the most benefit from the action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;James Hoffmann does say in that video that you're stopping the brewing process, but I think that was an over-simplification.  That great video is designed to simplify the process for beginners and explain the gist and some of the concepts involved.  That statement isn't literally correct, but I'll explain what he's probably referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's going on with the brewing and what's going on with the crust are basically independent processes.  Breaking up the crust doesn't really relate to the brewing, it's coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If breaking up the crust stopped the brewing, that would suggest that most of the coffee grounds are in the crust and being extracted there.  When you send them to the bottom, that stops the brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's the reverse.  Only a small portion of the grounds are in the crust, they contribute little to the extraction while they're suspended in the foam, and the rest of the grounds are responsible for most of the extraction independent of what's happening in or to the crust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two concurrent brewing-related processes that start when you pour the water into the cupping bowls: extraction of the coffee solubles from the grinds and settlement of the coffee particles to the bottom of the bowl.  These both continue until you empty the bowl.  For both, the bulk of it happens quickly and then tapers off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the extraction happens in the first few minutes.  After that, the brew continues to get a little bit stronger and the flavor profile fills out a little more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For settlement, the &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; stuff (normal-size grounds), falls to the bottom quickly, so it isn't a consideration, and it accounts for most of the coffee grounds.  The fines (dust-size coffee particles), account for a tiny amount of the coffee, but it's important for those to settle to the bottom so you don't taste them during cupping (there's no filtration in this procedure).  While the water is initially very hot, the fines don't do much settling.  As the water cools down, they slowly settle to the bottom.  By the time the brew temperature drops to a drinkable range, most of the fines have settled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So brewing is the important thing going on in the first few minutes.  When most of the extraction is done, that is about when most of the fines start to settle out.  So you can think of it as a &amp;quot;brewing phase&amp;quot; then a &amp;quot;settlement phase&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time normally selected to break up the crust roughly coincides with when the &amp;quot;brewing phase&amp;quot; can be thought to end, but that's just a way to conceptualize the process.  There is no hard transition point, and both processes are ongoing.  Breaking up the crust doesn't cause any change in the brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crust is a combination of coffee foam, oils, and floating grounds.  As water soaks into the coffee particles, it pushes out gas (mostly carbon dioxide), that collected after roasting.  The gas rises to the surface, taking some lighter coffee particles with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breaking up the crust might affect things in a subtle way.  The crust might act as an insulating blanket.  The brew loses heat through the cup, but the crust may reduce heat loss into the air.  So it would keep the brewing temperature a little higher a little longer.  To that extent, breaking up the crust would help the temperature drop a little faster, slowing down extraction, especially of flavors associated with over-extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At some point, the crust needs to be broken up in order to get at the coffee for tasting.  When's the best time to do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You want to give the floating stuff time to settle before you taste the brew.  But you also want to allow enough time for all the gas to escape the grounds, and as much of it as possible to escape into the air so you aren't stirring it into the coffee when you break up the crust.  And as mentioned, the timing might have a subtle affect on the flavor profile.  The timing is a compromise.  Doing it at about 4 minutes reduces the influence of technique and balances the various considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your observation about the insensitivity to the time is basically correct, although your range of 2 minutes to 8 minutes is probably more a reflection of how sensitive and trained your palate is, or what characteristics you were looking at.  The cupping procedures I've seen range from about 3 minutes to 5 minutes, with 4 minutes being typical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is &lt;strong&gt;one extraction per portafilter filling.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;So depending on whether you use the smaller one-shot or larger double-shot insert, you get one or two shots per button press &lt;em&gt;and after that, the grounds are considered spent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’d try to leave the grounds and push the button again and again, you wouldn’t just get increasingly weaker brews, but you would notice a lot of unpleasant flavors, from excessive bitterness to sour notes. It may seem wasteful, but that’s how espresso works - you pretty much get the best of each load in one go and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;———-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I know of a somewhat strange habit in a few Swiss households that will keep once-used Nespresso capsules (which can count as “a serving of espresso grounds”) and will use it once again for a purposely weak brew that goes into making „Kafi Fertig“ („finished coffee“), a concoction that gets spiked with a generous amount of „Träsch“ (a fruit brandy) and sugar. But that’s not a practical option for a spent coffee puck which can and probably will fall apart, not to mention the food safety issues if you tried to keep it for a while. I very much don’t recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="precise control over water re-mineralization"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I have been trying for, literally, decades, to get really good coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I roasted for several years, and for two cups during that time, I reached absolute nirvana with coffee that tasted so good it literally changed my life. However, it was so hit and miss, I essentially gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm desperately trying to be sure I'm doing the most that I can to do everything right to attempt to arrive at that taste with what I hope anyway, is recently roasted beans, though trying to locate a source of those, from a roaster that is willing to divulge the age of the roast (I am in a rural area, there is no &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; roaster I can form a relationship with) is proving difficult. Anyone who knows of such a mail order roaster, I would love to hear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the basics, I am trying to get the water exactly right as per the SCAA recommendations. If I understand those correctly, it should be chemical free water, with a TDS level of around 150.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I purchased an ISpring RO filter system, with a re-mineralization filter. It does it's job, though the TDS at the outlet turns out to be around 30-40 range. So, being an engineer, I assumed I could put 5 remineralization filters in series, and &amp;quot;of course&amp;quot; I'd end up with 5 * 30, or 150 TDS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hah !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not even close, with five such filters it didn't increase the TDS at all. I can almost see why when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my question is: How can I get re-mineralization up to 150 TDS with my RO water filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm aware of packets of minerals you can buy to add to water. I'm really looking for a &amp;quot;machine&amp;quot; solution, i.e., totally hands off yet extremely precise every time, without any sort of intervention other than turning on a tap. If there's no other solution, maybe I could build an automated &amp;quot;doser&amp;quot; to dump minerals in as the system calls for water. Maybe such a thing already exists ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks all for your help, and patience reading my question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'll take it as given that the problem you have comes from moisture in your finely ground coffee.  Indeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scielo.br/j/rbeaa/a/5Mq6qBqfDBZ5DqYBx3nkXTb/?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show finely ground coffee, other variables being held constant, has a greater hygroscopic tendancy (absorbing moisture from the surroundings during storage) and a higher angle of repose α:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Angle of repose is useful in order to acquire information regarding solid flowability. According to Shittu &amp;amp; Lawal (2007), during powder reconstitution, water molecules that hydrate the product's surface tend to reduce cohesivity between particles, allowing a rapid water penetration; thus, powders that possess high angles of repose, have higher difficulty to incorporate water. All factors tested (roast level, grind size and storage time), and the interactions between them, significantly influenced the angle of repose (α).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll report the experiment that I did with removing moisture from used espresso coffee grounds by repeated microwaving.  This is no guarantee that it will resolve the problem reported by the OP, where in an earlier Question &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/5979/south-indian-filter-not-brewing-properly&quot;&gt;South Indian filter not brewing properly&lt;/a&gt; it was said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know why, but suddenly it is taking longer to finish the brew and sometimes (mostly from the second time) the water doesn't even go down. It just stays in the upper part of the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method of brewing is unfamiliar to me, and the description &amp;quot;to brew without using the middle small instrument which looks like the one used in a french press&amp;quot; sounds like it is akin to a pour over (the tag &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/drip-brew&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;drip-brew&amp;#39;&quot; aria-label=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;drip-brew&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;drip-brew-container&quot;&gt;drip-brew&lt;/a&gt; was used there and here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of drying coffee grounds was dismissed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/4744/34&quot;&gt;this previous Answer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t attempt to dry wet grounds - the quality would likely suffer and for brewing they will be made wet again, which would make the drying step moot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However there is perhaps something about the method of brewing at issue here that avoids these objections.  So to proceed with the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hkoqG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hkoqG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;experiment drying&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the left is a frozen portafilter basket with used espresso grounds, which presents something of a maximally moist batch of coffee grounds.  I emptied the basket into a spare microwaveable dish (a creme brulee crock).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Setting my 1200W microwave to 30 seconds, I ran it and checked to see how hot or warm the dish and its contents became.  In the first run the contents became noticeably steamy, but then heating declined (water is specifically absorbing of the microwave radiation).  After a dozen runs the used grounds seemed to be contributing nothing to the warming of the dish (an empty crock by itself gets warmed but not hot in 30 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To the touch the grounds now feel dry, and as a test I put the dish in the freezer for 30 minutes.  This produced no clumping or grounds sticking to the dish.  So I'm going to say this was a quick and effective technique to dry the grounds per se, without resort to expensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uline.com/BL_1004/Silica-Gel-Desiccants?pricode=WB5888&amp;amp;Sitelink=silica_gel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;desiccant supplies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obhYSf1ogoo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DIY vaccum freeze drying&lt;/a&gt; equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally we invoke the platitude that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure:  storing the fresh coffee ground in packaging that prevents moisture absorbtion is easier than trying to fix a problem later on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Really, it's whatever you prefer. Of course you don't want to drink it so hot that you scald your mouth, so the high end is generally in the range of any other beverage that you drink hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But your perception of the flavors is affected by the temperature. If you've ever participated in a coffee tasting, you focus not only on the flavor profile, but how it changes as the coffee cools down. While it's still very hot, you perceive less of the flavor in general. As the temperature drops into a range where your taste buds work well, you'll perceive more full and nuanced flavor, and notice a change in the flavor profile as it gets cooler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you order coffee from a coffee shop, they don't wait until the temperature is at some optimum before giving it to you. If you don't chug it down but drink it over time as it cools, you'll get to experience a range of flavors. Depending on your coffee preferences, you can choose to experience the full range of flavors, or find a temperature you like best and drink it all close to that point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That applies no matter how you brew it (assuming it's hot).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;The burrs in a burr grinder are held at a fixed distance. This distance is determined by the grind selector mechanism. In theory, this distance determines the size of grind particles, regardless of the size of input particles (whole beans, half beans, broken beans, pre-ground beans). That's why burr grinders are superior to propeller-type coffee mills which makes all particles ever smaller by bashing everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So (in theory) you should be able to set the grind you want and run the course &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; grind through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've done this, regrinding &amp;quot;French Press&amp;quot; into espresso.

Again, tastes vary, so try what suits you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a French press works with all levels of grinding, the usual recommendation is to use medium to not-quite-coarse. Too fine may clog the filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't skip the bloom: poor a small amount of hot water over the coffee grounds and let it sit for half a minute to release trapped gases. This can improve the flavor and aroma of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like your handling of the plunger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And remember: it's your coffee, your taste, and you will be served well if you follow your intuition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently switched over to pour over coffee from my previous drip machine setup as I heard that I would get &amp;quot;more flavor&amp;quot; that way. I'm using a gooseneck kettle, v60 and scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Overall, I think the coffee is pretty similar, maybe 5-10% more flavorful w pour-over vs drip. I wonder if some of the perceived improvement is a placebo effect (extra effort = &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; coffee).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What do you think? Is pour-over supposed to be significantly more flavorful than drip or just a bit more? (I'm using fresh ground beans in both cases; I prefer dark roast coffee).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Appreciate the input!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;It's not very useful to talk about flavor with coffee because different people will perceive the very same drink as having different flavors and amounts of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather, one way to measure extraction is to measure total dissolved solids (TDS) dissolved in the water both before and after brewing. While total dissolved solids isn't a measure of flavor, it should give a general sense of amount of potentially perceptible compounds in the drink, though of course a given individual may or may not be able to taste some of those solids since, you know, everyone's different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why do people say pour-over tastes better than drop? Two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reason #1: Drop coffee makers are the easiest to use. Programmable models can be set up with coffee and water in the evening, then brew for you while you sleep and have your coffee ready for you in the morning. Fabulous. Except ease of use doesn't translate to ease of care. Drip machines are often poorly maintained because of the expectation of convenience, and poorly maintained coffee machines make bad coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reason #2: Again with the convenience of drip coffee makers, two core design philosophies compromise on drink quality: drip coffee makers often encourage preloading coffee well in advance of brewing, which leads to stale coffee, and heated carafes to keep coffee hot degrade flavor the longer the brew sits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the differences between pour-over and drip depend mostly on how you use each. If you leverage the conveniences of the drip maker, you'll get a drink most people would call lower quality. But if you always brew freshly ground coffee in your drip brewer and consistently clean and descale your drip brewer, you may find that the performance of the drip machine is similar to the performance of a pour-over method. That's because the two methods actually are very similar in function: hot water is poured (dropped) slowly over a bed of coffee grounds and allowed to drip through, pulled by gravity. In fact, the automatic drip machine was invented in the first place to serve as an automatic pour-over solution. (Yes, pour-over existed long before drip, with the first commercial form being the Mr. Biggin coffee pot of the 1780s, featuring a top chamber designed to fit a sock which would act as a filter for coffee to be piled on top and hot water poured over all and allowed to drip through--the first commercial pour-over solution.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: People are lazy and often end up making &amp;quot;lazy coffee&amp;quot; with drip machines. YMMV and results may vary depending on your own personal level of laziness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

But I'm wondering if 4 days is pushing it - will it lose flavor or gain off-flavors after that long ?   And, would it be a good idea to freeze the concentrate after I make it, to minimize deterioration while travelling (figure about 5 hours door-to-door) ?  I'd store it in a not-quite-full Nalgene bottle (the hard Lexan kind that doesn't leach nasty tastes), so hopefully freezing won't crack it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;While I've never seen that kind of gadget before, I assume it's essentially a moka pot. If so, there should be a basket in the bottom of the gadget and a chamber for water beneath it. The idea is that you heat water to produce steam until the steam builds enough pressure to push through the coffee. The roof of this bottom chamber then condenses into a funnel near the center. The continuing pressure provided by the generated steam will push steam and extracted coffee solids up the funnel until it reaches the top chamber, condenses, and collects there. That's coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This device seems to feature a novel valve which I assume is capable of redirecting the steam. Honestly this strikes me as a terrible idea because normal moka pots don't generate sufficient pressure to power a steam wand. Also this device looks... dangerous. You'd have to hold it to turn the valve, and there doesn't appear to be a heat safe handle or grip to support that. Better use some hefty oven mitts because that sucker will get hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also that device won't actually make espresso. Moka pot coffee is quite different from espresso. You may well like it once you get the hang of it, but to me a moka pot is sort of like an in-the-middle between a French press and a pour-over. Which is to say, it's not espresso. They do make good coffee though as long as you don't burn it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Short answer: no. Tamping harder will not have the effect you desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine's pump by itself does not produce pressure. Pressure is created when the flow of water is interrupted by the coffee grounds. This will cause flow to stop while the pump works to push water through the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tamping harder will in the worst case lead to a buildup of greater pressure, not lesser. In the best case, because coffee grounds are often rigid (depending on grind) and can't be &amp;quot;smushed&amp;quot;, it may make no difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more reliable solution would be to grind slightly coarser. Go slow with increases and test each stop. A coarser grind will reduce the amount of compaction tamping causes, which will reduce pressure buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that ideal grind size varies with bean variety and grinder. You may need to adjust grind size if you start purchasing a new brand of coffee, or you may ideally want to adjust for every new package of coffee you open, as even same variety batches may have minor differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;There isn't a maximum concentration you can reach through the coffee:water ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With drip or immersion brewing, the coffee grounds absorb and hold about 2 grams of water for every gram of coffee. If you brew with 1:2 coffee:water, all of your brew would remain trapped in the grounds if you rely on gravity for extraction. Slightly more water would yield some beverage. That would produce the maximum achievable concentration for the specific brewing parameters, but it would not be at chemical saturation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With an espresso process, you can brew at 1:2, or even 1:1, and still get a substantial portion of the extraction out. This is about as concentrated an extraction as you can get. But even at this concentration, the component compounds are not close to saturation. If you let an espresso cool, none of the compounds will precipitate or crystallize out of solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, let's say that you could reach a saturation-level concentration with some hypothetical form of brewing. There would still be no maximum concentration by your definition of not caring about the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brewing parameters determine how much of each compound goes into solution (that's why you can use them to manipulate the flavor profile). Similarly, the concentration would limit the maximum amount of each compound going into solution. The components are each at different concentrations in the coffee beans, and have different saturation points. So as the brew concentration increased, its flavor profile would change, and you could use that to manipulate the taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You would still have a substantial amount of each flavor component, but the ratios between the components would change. It wouldn't be much different than varieties of coffee beans having different flavor profiles because those compounds are present in different ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Does the color of the liquid also change and become a lot lighter? If so, you are definitely pulling to much water through your puck.

Crema &amp;quot;happens&amp;quot; because the water is under such a high pressure, that the  CO2 from the coffee is forced into the liquid, resulting in that foam we call crema.

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;In a broad sense, the roast of the coffee has a significant impact on the acidity of the coffee. Check the type of coffee beans you're using.

If the size is coarse, acidity increases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other multiple factors, but these are the most common ones. Also, assuming by &amp;quot;cafe coffee&amp;quot; you mean non-specialty coffee, the lack of acidity is due to the instant nature of it, that uses dark roast, and extreme fine grains to reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the environment where the coffee beans are from also affect the acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm using a standard Aeropress and a Hario slim grinder. With the cold brew method (where you stir the ground coffee in cold water for a minute) I can get something very refreshing and tea-like, but with hot brew methods I've had very inconsistent results with the James Hoffmann method, the bypass method, and the pourover method, using supermarket medium roast decaf beans, as well as supermarket light roast beans. Sometimes I get coffee that borders on delicious, and sometimes it's worse than the coffee I can buy at Sonic. I'm using filtered water and I'm grinding my coffee twice, once at double the number of clicks and then again at the actual intended number, as I've heard that makes for a more consistent grind with the Hario slim. Still, I look at my ground coffee and see a wide range of particle size, so I figure the inconsistency of brew has to do with my grinder. I currently cannot afford a nicer grinder, so I'm looking to see if there are any other tricks I can do to get more consistent coffee. I know with cheap beans and a cheap grinder that there's an upper limit on how nice it can be, but it would still be nice to have a consistent 5-6/10 cup instead of the 2-7/10 range I've been getting. I do also worry that maybe I'm being put off by otherwise good brew methods by having unlucky grinds on days where I try them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

I've seen ratios by volume of 1 cup Grounds to 4 cups water, 1 to 8, and also 1 pound per Gallon.  (I did the 1:4 at home in a 1-gallon jar and it was VERY strong - I'm guessing that was the Concentrate ratio...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general plan is to set up the container in the evening (around 8 or 9 PM), set it in the refrigerator overnight, and around 9:00 AM drain it into serving containers, so it has 12 hours to steep.

      <Answer>
        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;What you're describing sounds like &lt;em&gt;channeling&lt;/em&gt;. Channeling is caused by a less than ideal combination of grind size, tamp pressure, and tamp evenness (grind distribution). It can also be caused in part by roast level of the beans, with very dark, brittle beans more likely to cause channeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Channeling is when the water, under pressure from the pump, finds a fast route through the puck by creating or finding a channel. It sprays because the water is under pressure and because there is a larger volume of water being pushed by the pump than what fits through the channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is part of the espresso experience and takes practice to perfect. Try different grind settings first, and make sure you're tamping. Even bad tamping is better than no tamping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tamping should be level with the rim of the portafilter, but the level of grounds in the portafilter doesn't have to rise to the rim (and in fact shouldn't). Before tamping, tap the portafilter basket lightly while holding the portafilter to shake the grounds into a somewhat even distribution. Then, using your tamper, press hard but not super hard--thirty pounds is the recommended pressure for tamping. Place your portafilter on a scale and practice of you're not good at estimating your strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can't find a grind setting that works after working out a good tamping routine, the next most likely culprit is your coffee. If you live in a place where you can buy freshly roasted coffee (roasted within the past week), I highly recommend that. Otherwise look for a small coffee shop--not a chain--that sells beans sourced from their own supply--not prepackaged--and buy those. Finally if none of these options are available where you live, look online. There are a number of coffee roasters that ship freshly roasted coffee, though this method is often more expensive due to shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your bottomless portafilter should be helping you visualize channeling to help you better recognize problems with your tamping routine. It's also a beautiful way to make espresso when the water is correctly pushed through the whole puck, coming together in a tiger's eye striped column of absolute beauty on its way down to the shot glass. When you see that single column down the middle, you'll know you got it right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

There are various processes used to dehydrate milk, and higher heat methods tend to change the molecular structure of the milk more significantly than lower heat methods. However, neither any compound found in milk nor any compound produced by any method of pasteurizing milk can react chemically with  either water or any compound of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Milk itself is an emulsion of liquid fat molecules and dairy proteins in water. Adding dehydrated milk--aka powdered milk--to water and mixing vigorously simply recreates the emulsion. The dehydration process used to turn the milk into a powder may produce some compounds which cannot form a colloid in water and may sink. But there are no chemical reactions.

Moreover, you probably do not want them all. You just want to extract the most delicious part&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is quite easy to extract caffeine just by leaving the beans in water even in a very short amount of time&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, most of the caffeine dissolves in the water way early before any of the delicious oils dissolve. I have never had any measurement by myself but it is said that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;around 90% of caffeine is extracted even in a few seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;around 15% of oils are extracted in a typical cup.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; For example, over-brewed coffee tasted bitter. Most granule coffees are bitter, too. As they are prepared by extracting nearly everything out of the beans with huge percolators, then drying the extracted syrup out.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; This is actually how Swiss de-caffeination method works.

However, this can vary depending on factors like grind size, water temperature, and personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy a milder cup, you might opt for &lt;strong&gt;a shorter steeping time of around 3 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from buying pre-ground coffee to whole beans and I am grinding it myself at home for a French Press.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that grinding coffee every time I want to make it would be the freshest way to enjoy it. However, this is time-consuming to do every morning. I typically only drink one cup per day so if I grind the whole bag at once I am afraid it would get stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What would be the best median between grinding it every day or the whole bag at once so that the ground coffee still remains relatively fresh?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166&quot;&gt;previous question/answer here&lt;/a&gt;, even whole bean coffee may be appreciably stale after 14 days, and ground coffee within minutes.  If you are considering pre-grinding, any number of days is probably going to affect flavor.  Why not experiment?  I don't think you will want to wait 14 days with ground, but you could experiment and see if you can taste a difference after 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mention using a Black and Decker grinder.  If that's a typical blade grinder and not one of their burr grinders, you might find that having your beans ground with a coarse setting at the coffee shop tastes better even at 14 days with a French Press.  Blade grinders don't grind as evenly and can result in some pretty fine coffee grounds that negatively affect French Press.  Grind consistency is important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Is there any possibility to get a cup of Single Origin coffee when you grind Blended coffee beans?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blended&lt;/em&gt; coffee is mixed by several different kinds of coffee beans while &lt;em&gt;Single Origin&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;SOE&lt;/em&gt; coffee uses only one type. Given a background where you bought a bag of &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; coffee beans and now trying to grind it by yourself for a cup of morning coffee. As the bean bag was not packaged/mixed evenly, the beans you put inside the grinder are therefore not according to their &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; percentage as expected. As a result, can I say every cup of &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; is unique due to the random bean ratio, and it may have an extreme case where the &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; coffee you drink is actually a &lt;em&gt;Single Origin&lt;/em&gt; one?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="How to minimize mess with an espresso maker"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I purchased a Breville Bambino Plus recently. I was previously using a Nespresso. The primary motivations for the upgrade were microfoam milk and a wider variety of flavors (Nespresso pods all tasting similar to me).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a great success in those areas, but I’m struggling mightily with the mess I make each time I prepare a double shot. Coffee grounds inevitably spill at various steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What can I do to improve this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mess opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Putting the grounds into the portafilter. I have to carefully mound it up before tamping and inevitably some small amount spills before I have tamped.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slight excess after tamping. Despite weighing the exact dose I usually end up with a bit extra. Breville supplied a blade for this to scrape off the extra but it’s messy and if I’m not careful the whole shot flies out when I’m trying to dump the excess&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Knock bar. What magic incantation is required here?  I just bang a lot and about half the time grounds fly outside the bar. Also, often the portafilter basket itself comes out which creates even more mess!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prepping my next shot. Sometimes I run just water through to heat up my mug and if I do so there’s always some grounds in the portafilter along with some water. Where did they come from and is that bad?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Several things you could do come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to carefully mound it up before tamping and inevitably some small amount spills before I have tamped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check how much coffee the filter inside your portafilter is rated for. The Bambino Plus uses a non standard 54mm portafilter and from what I can see, you should have received 4 different filters. Only use the ones with straight walls and if your grounds are flowing over, you are probably using too much coffee. They say it can handle up to 18g in the largest basket but that feels like it would be too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slight excess after tamping. Despite weighing the exact dose I usually end up with a bit extra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean you end up with a bit extra? When you tamp the grounds, it should be compressed and at that point the only thing you should do is brew the coffee and not mess around with the already prepped puck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;often the portafilter basket itself comes out&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're supposed to knock with the basket towards the rubber, knocking the grounds loose and then just lift it to allow them to fall out. That way there is no possibility of the basket flying out. You will never be able to get every single piece of coffee out, which is why most people use a microfiber cloth to clean out the basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;there’s always some grounds in the portafilter along with some water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next time after knocking out the grounds and wiping the basket with a cloth, remove the basket and check if there are grounds in the space between the basket and the spout. If there are a lot of grounds there, your filter basket might have too many large holes or you are grinding too finely. If there is nothing there, check your brew head. It might be full of grounds, which is mostly caused by using too much coffee in a shot. You can clean that with a simple brush. Make sure there is no coffee stuck to the brew head as it might get rancid over time and negatively impact the taste of your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTFsBqhpLes&amp;amp;list=PLxz0FjZMVOl3MuAzK5l3gjakoOGrmK8fP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video series&lt;/a&gt; on espresso by James Hoffmann, where he goes into every aspect of brewing espresso. Seeing what he does differently might give you an indication as to which things you can change or adjust to make your experience more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; to answer the comment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the tamp doesn't fully occupy the width of the basket&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should really consider getting a tamper that is suitable for your basket, there should be barely any room between the tamper and the walls - ideally, just enough to prevent an airtight seal. It really helps to ensure even flow and it prevents loose grounds floating on top of your puck when you remove it after a brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if I knock immediately after a shot it still makes some mess because there's a small amount of liquid in the basket&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little bit of liquid is normal but this might also be caused by the loose coffee that wasn't tamped. It could also be caused by pulling a shot that is too long. In general, try to aim for a ratio between 1:2 (18g in 26g out) and 1:3 (18g in 44g out).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water temperature:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I like to boil some water in a tea pot or something then add the water to the Moka pot. Starting with cold water takes time to heat it up, and this heating process will cause your coffee to have more bitter and acidic tastes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grind size:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Kinda depends on what you want. If you use finer grinds, the coffee taste stronger. However, as you pointed out, Moka pot can't be used to make espresso. So if you use fine grinds for an espresso machine, the coffee will turn out to be unpleasantly strong! A grind size between espresso and french press is good. Sorry if this is not helpful...... If you live in the US, the default grind you can find in any grocery store is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time of the brew:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Related to water temp. Start with boiled water, brew until coffee stops going. Of course no need to open the lid and watch - it's time when you see steam coming out the top of the pot. Once you see that, remove it from the stove right away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I always fill the basket. If you feel it's too strong that way, thy rougher grinds. If you don't fill it, I can imagine the coffee will be moving around when hot steam goes through, and that affects extraction. Filling the basket full makes sure they stay as a nice layer all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your coffee!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I may hesitate to call an Irish Coffee a cocktail (it’s typically listed under hot drinks in a menu), but in any case, the coffee from your setup is pretty much exactly what reflects the preparation method that would have been prevalent in Ireland back in the 1940s. Another option that would also fit the time window would be a percolator, or a vacuum coffee maker (siphon).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strength is up to you, usually people would aim for a slightly stronger brew as sugar, whisky and cream will be a strong counter-part, in a gustatory sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern preparations may use an espresso machine and draw a lungo, simply because it may be the setup available in many bar or restaurant settings. There is no reason though to invest in one just to make an authentic Irish Coffee (you wouldn’t).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, there is no one-fits-all coffee preparation for cocktails. An espresso martini would obviously call for an espresso, but there are countless recipes out there that use pretty much any kind of coffee.

        <Body Body="&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether to stir or not to stir is entirely a matter of personal opinion. Stirring will create the effect of superior extraction, as not stirring will saturate the water around the grounds before stirring is complete. However this can lead to &lt;em&gt;overextraction&lt;/em&gt; if your grind is too fine or if your brew runs too long or too hot. The effect of greater extraction may also be undesirable with certain batches of beans. And lastly, there's positively no accounting for taste. Don't feel bad about doing it the way you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plunging or not shouldn't make any difference at all unless you're compressing the grounds when you plunge. If you plunge with enough force to compact the grounds, you can cause the release of compounds from the coffee that are undesirable in terms of taste. The effect here is similar to overextraction due to too long brew time. Generally I advise plumbing just to make the pour easier, but a halfway plunge is plenty sufficient. Don't squeeze the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

Water takes longer to infiltrate coarse grounds due to the power surface area vs fine grinds and the equal density. Because it takes longer, compounds extracted at the beginning of the brew sit in the hot water longer, and more undesirable compounds are extracted from the exteriors of the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is actually the reason why finer grinds are preferred for Aeropress brewing. The water can quickly extract the flavors from most of the grounds with fine grinds, and the harsh, bitter flavors that are typical of other submersion methods (looking at you, French press) are avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

But the discussions leave out the obvious question of how the pore size difference affects extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a big range of pore sizes in metal filters (20-800 microns vs. 10-20 microns for paper), so there must be a lot of variation in their effect. But if sediment is getting through a metal filter, the larger pores would allow water to flow through more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that for drip coffee makers or pour-over, the grinds are in contact with the water for a shorter time, which would result in less extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less extraction should result in a &amp;quot;brighter&amp;quot; (more acidic) flavor profile, and fruity and sweet flavors less masked, maybe even weaker flavor. However, the discussions conflate the &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; contributed by the fines and oils (and maybe the flavors of those), and claim that it's paper filters, instead, which yield a flavor profile associated with lower extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question:&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to paper filters, do metal filters have an appreciable effect on extraction time (and extraction level), when used with drip coffee makers or pour-over?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Seeking Advice on Importing Roasted Specialty Coffee Beans from Brazil into the US: Permitting and Legal Requirements"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm a Brazilian currently residing in the United States, and I'm exploring the idea of importing specialty coffee beans roasted in my hometown in Brazil to sell here in the US market. My hometown is renowned for producing unique and high-quality coffee, and I believe there's a niche market for it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I'm encountering challenges navigating the complex process of permits and legal requirements associated with importing roasted goods into the US. Despite conducting some initial research, I still feel overwhelmed and unsure about the necessary steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've come across suggestions to hire a customs broker to assist with the process, but the associated costs seem prohibitive, especially for someone like me who is at the initial stages of starting a business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I'm reaching out for insights and advice. Do you have any experience or expertise in importing goods into the US, particularly in the realm of specialty food products such as roasted coffee beans?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate any guidance, tips, or resources you can offer to help me navigate this journey more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your assistance and support!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;This isn't an answer to what you asked, but perhaps an alternate approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes the beans unique is the beans, themselves. The roasting process can be replicated anywhere (by someone with the equipment and skill, which can be replicated anywhere).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If stored properly, the raw beans will last a very long time without degradation. But once they're roasted, they have a very short shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what's legally required to import raw beans, and how that would be different from importing roasted goods. But some considerations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw beans could be shipped in bulk by comparatively inexpensive methods (boat), and be used up over a long time. Roasted beans would need fast transportation (air), in small enough quantities to be used up soon after arrival. This would add significant costs that would put you at a competitive disadvantage for business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any form of import will require inspection on arrival by Customs. This would not affect raw beans. Roasted beans would need to be kept in sealed containers until use. Opening any container for inspection would ruin all the coffee in the container.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importing raw beans might leave you with similar kinds of regulatory questions to answer. But at least that might put you on a better track as a business idea, and the information might be easier to track down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Can I speed up the laxative effect of coffee (maximum in 30-45 minutes)?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hi everyone, I have a hydrogen-sulfur type SIBO disease and If I&#xA;don't defecate everyday, the poop accumulates in the bowels and make&#xA;me pass gas (believe me it has really foul smell like rotten egg). I&#xA;everyday defecate through the laxative effects of the granular&#xA;coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I put 3 teaspoon granular coffee, 3 cube sugar in every mug that I&#xA;drink, and I drink 3 mug of coffee in total. If I don't add sugar in&#xA;the coffee or I don't smoke cigaretts(it's too harmfull please don't&#xA;smoke) with coffee or the coffee is cold, then the laxative effect of&#xA;the coffee decrease too much(atleast for me).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And my main problem is that I drink that much coffee to defecate but&#xA;it takes 2 hours of mine. As an unemployed person, 2 hours is nothing&#xA;for me but because I'll be in working life soon and 2 hours'll have&#xA;a worth as gold for me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; How can I decrease the time that I need for the coffee's laxative effect?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I tried for it:&lt;/strong&gt; I drank hot water instead of coffee(I drank 6-7 mug of water for the same effect) but it took same amount time. I think to decrease the amount of water in the mug and increase the amount of coffee but I don't know if it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Is espresso supposed to be bitter and drank on its own or am I supposed to add something to it?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;first time posting here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was eating at a bistro the other day and noticed that they had &amp;quot;Espresso Shot&amp;quot; on the menu. Now I'm not really a coffee connoisseur and I might be burned at the stake by the people here but I've only ever drank instant coffee, the powdered ones you mix with a cup of hot water and stir. These kinds of coffee are often sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've heard of espresso before as something that gives you a kick and since I've never had one before, I ordered it. The dude serving asked me if I was sure since I ordered just the espresso shot and I said yes. Then he asked me again just to verify and I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was served it, it was pretty dang bitter but not so bad that I couldn't tolerate it. I drank it all after finishing my meal and went on my way but thinking back to the guy asking me twice, I couldn't help but wonder, was I supposed to add anything to it in the first place? Or was it supposed to be that bitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to note that I don't know what kind of espresso it was nor did I even knew there were different kinds of espresso until I looked it up. The menu just literally said &amp;quot;Espresso Shot.........PRICE&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;No, you didn’t do anything wrong. There are lots of people that enjoy their espresso “pure” and most would argue that you can enjoy the unadulterated flavor best that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s also no harm in adding some sugar to your coffee or even a bit of milk. And of course the espresso is a key component in various “espresso-and-milk” combinations. Depending on where you live, espresso  and the coffee culture based on espresso may be uncommon - your question implies that this may be the case here - and servers learned the hard way that not all customers will deal with the relatively bitter unsweetened drink without complaints. The espresso per se will be bitter, especially if you are used to sweet instant coffee drinks, in that case a spoonful of sugar can be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that a good quality espresso should not be excessively bitter, but of course we cannot judge what you got.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="Baratza Sette 270 (not Wi) poor man's grind-by-weight"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I currently own a Breville Infuser espresso machine and the Smart Grinder Pro, but I'm looking to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have my eyes on the Baratza Sette 270 line, and ideally I would go for the grind-by-weight 270Wi, but it's a bit out of my price range (currently $200 more expensive than the regular grind-by-time 270).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apparently it's possible to simulate the grind-by-weight feature of the 270Wi in the regular 270 by keeping the hopper fully empty, weighting the exact amount of beans for a single dose and then dumping that into the hopper. I know it's a bit more work, but if there are no other drawbacks, I am more than willing to do it for the $200 savings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions: would that really work? Is the result worse, similar or better than the 270Wi's grind-by-weight feature? Are there any drawbacks to this? I'm worried the grinder is designed to work with a minimum amount of beans in the hopper and might have issues (whether grinding quality, or even mechanical issues that might shorten the grinder's lifespan) when working with just a single dose's worth of beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An additional question: would the 54mm portafilter of the Breville Infuser machine fit into the holder in the Sette 270, or do I need to grind into a pot and then dump it into the portafilter?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

        <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;Dumping by tipping the machine and using gravity won't work perfectly because some grinds stick inside the machine due to static buildup and the fact that those tiny pieces are very lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead I highly recommend the Eureka Silenzio. This grinder has a much narrower connection point from the hopper to the grinder, and you can remove the hopper and fit a bulb blower over that pipe very nicely. There are some kits you can buy to do this by searching &amp;quot;Eureka Mignon Hack&amp;quot; or by finding some kind of product with an attached blower you can cut off. You can fit a piece of PVC pipe into the connection point where the hopper would normally go to create a single or double dosing tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add beans the PVC pipe, where gravity pulls them into the grinder. Flip your blower bulb upside down so it blocks beans from bouncing out. Grind into your portafilter. When done, knock the porta filter gently on the countertop to settle the grounds, then put it back under the grinder, flip your blower bulb back over and fit it over the PVC pipe, and blow. The blower will push out the grounds that stuck, and you will see here how big a mistake relying on gravity is. It's a good bit of coffee!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <Title Title="How suitable is a glass pot for making Turkish Coffee with milk?"/>
    <Body Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm looking into Turkish Coffee and it looks very appealing from a flavor, caffeine strength. and cleanup perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was considering one of the electric machines to boil, but it kinda seems like they have a very short and harsh boil.  So now I'm more leaning towards just a little pot.  Now, the shape of the pot seems to matter.  From what I can tell a small diameter will help to keep the sediment at the bottom.  But what is the purpose of the neck?  To control the boiling and prevent spills?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For material, I like the copper but am now leaning towards just a little glass pot shaped as the traditional Turkish Coffee pots are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear how glass works in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Particularly as I intend to make my coffee with milk rather than water.  My concern being that cleaning a delicate glass container of milk products sounds unfeasible.  So it would have to be metal for milk?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>
