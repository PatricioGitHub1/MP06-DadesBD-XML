Lately it's been having a lot of trouble pushing the water through the coffee.  We can hear the pump pumping, but the water just barely drips out.  We end up having to pull it 2 or 3 times to get a full shot (or just wait for the drips to fill up the shot glass).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I opened up this machine once before in the hopes of cleaning it, but found almost everything inside pretty clean and the plumbing is all sealed up.  So I'm a little befuddled as to what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do I fix my machine so that the shots come out in a single pull?  I wonder if my pump just can form enough pressure anymore - can I measure the pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A note on the grounds:  We have the grinder set to the finest grind, which comes out like a fine sand.  We've had it this way for a long time and not had any problems.  We fill the basket to about 1/2 full (it's a double shot basket, and we only need one shot - the single shot basket was fed to the garbage disposal years ago) and tamp.  I've been tamping more lightly recently, thinking that the problem was grounds that are too compressed to let the water through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2069" LastActivityDate="2022-03-09T08:21:50.693" Title="Espresso drips out slowly" Tags="&lt;espresso-machine&gt;" AnswerCount="12" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0"/>

This&#xA;  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution&#xA;  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the&#xA;  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and&#xA;  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it&#xA;  releases even more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use&#xA;  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.&#xA;  Moderation in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3795" LastEditorUserId="3813" LastEditDate="2017-02-02T16:38:14.497" LastActivityDate="2018-03-02T20:08:09.617" Title="What is a café allongé, and how is it pronounced?"

The dripper is a stainless steel type with a couple fine mesh filters in it, which lets me do pour overs without a paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's my method: I'm putting 3 tablespoons of grounds into my dripper, and then with a kettle of 17oz, just off the boiling water, begin pouring over my grounds with enough water to fill the dripper half full. I wait 10 seconds while the grounds bloom and then I fill the dripper to the top and wait for the coffee to brew. Then, when the dripper gets about half empty, I fill it back up with water. I intend to end with ~16oz of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My problem is that the grounds end up plugging up my dripper and the drip process ends up taking forever.

Particularly I never brew the combination corresponding to case 3.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the expected flavor profile of the espresso produced in each of these cases (more/less acid, sour, sweet, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which of these could be called a ristretto, normale, or lungo?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What parameters should I aim for in each of these cases, in terms of: mass of grounds in the filter before brewing (in g), shot volume (in ml) or mass (in g) in the cup, and extraction time (in s)? I have heard extraction times should be always 25 s regardless of the coffee dose and the volume of water, so 25 s for all combinations above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This machine has a pressure gauge, indicating water pressure during extraction. Should I watch for a particular value in this gauge, or ignore it and just watch the extraction time? Currently my procedure for adjusting the grind is to make it coarser when pressure is in the upper 2/3rds of the gauge range, and finer when pressure is in the lower 1/3rd of the gauge range. I do not regularly monitor extraction time for adjusting the grind. Using combination 4, and adjusting the grind such that the pressure gauge stays close to the midpoint, extraction times are in the range of 25-30 s. However, using the same grind settings but dosing enough water for a single (combination 2), extraction times are closer to 15 s. To get closer to 25 s I would have to let the pressure gauge reach values way into the upper range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closing: although I enjoy the taste of combination 2, it appears most of the water stays in the coffee puck, and the volume actually dispensed in the cup is very small (about 15-20 ml). Perhaps I should reprogram the water volume to get something closer to, say, 30 ml? Would this help me get an extraction time closer to 25 s for this dose (assuming this is the &quot;ideal&quot; extraction time)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="96" LastEditorUserId="1848" LastEditDate="2016-07-21T20:19:47.533" LastActivityDate="2016-11-01T14:12:32.027" Title="What are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?"

It seems like I grind about 2 and a half tablespoons for two ounces of water. I then &quot;tamp&quot; the coffee down with a flat spoon. I put it into my machine, turn it on, and wait like a minute for the hot espresso to come out. It sort of gives something similar to crema, but it seems for just like foam, and it doesn't last very long either. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to generate crema using a steam espresso machine, or is it really not possible? Am I doing something wrong? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1102" LastActivityDate="2016-08-31T04:52:39.127" Title="Steam-Powered Espresso Machine: Crema?"

Several sources have told me that I really should dose according to the dose label on my basket - no more than +/- 1 gram. I have tried to brew with 14 grams of coffee, but have failed miserably:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My shots always run too fast and the taste is pretty light and sour (underextracted?).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have pushed my grinder (Baratza Sette 270Wi) to the smallest possible grind-size, but it's still too fast. Though at these smallest sizes it's getting pretty tricky to keep the water running evenly through the pack. Again, various sources have told me that I shouldn't go too fine with my grind. The manual of my grinder suggests starting with grind setting 7E for espresso. At that setting with 14 grams of coffee I'm getting a 30g shot in 16 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have experimented with various ways of getting my tamping as consistent and level as possible. My current tamping process as follows: knock the portafilter several times against table to level off the initial pile of grains, spin the leveling tool, press down firmly with tamper.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have fiddled a bit around with pressure. Haven't gone out of the 8..11 bar range. As expected I get a little longer shots with 8 bar. Mostly I've tried to settle to using 9.5 bars.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haven't yet tried changing water temperature - it's been 93 degrees C.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I've tried with a 2 second pre-infusion and without. Not much of a difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's worth mentioning that my timings are measured from pulling the lever - but it takes at least 5 seconds for the first drips to appear (about 9 seconds with pre-infusion).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also worth mentioning is that I'm getting lots of variation from shot to shot with exactly the same settings. Like 31g shot in 22 seconds, and then 34g shot in 17 seconds. This seems to happen more when I go to these finer grind sizes. I suspect uneven extraction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have also used 3 different types of coffee beans. No real difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the smallest possible grind size, 8 bar pressure and 15g coffee I've managed to get 31g shot in 27 seconds. But it tasted very underextracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best results I've had have been when I've increased dose to 17..18 grams. Then I'm able to also use courser grinds. With these doses I'm finally getting some more crema and the taste is no more watery. Though my basket is pretty-much overflowing at such a large dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the espresso-making tutorials I've seen always tend to deal with 18 gram or larger baskets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is there hope in brewing espresso with 14 gram basket (and what should I change)?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Or should I get myself a 18 gram basket and move on (my portafilter seems to have enough room to put a larger basket in).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9077" LastActivityDate="2020-10-05T11:10:59.467" Title="Can I brew espresso with 14g portafilter basket?"

The dosing I used was generally recommended for a single shot of espresso, but I used the 2-cup pressurised filter instead of the other smaller one that's said to be for PODs. &lt;strong&gt;Question 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Any recommendations for getting a better shot of espresso from these things that I already have?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also would like to try the non-pressurised filter selling online as it's claimed to produce better quality espresso.

The espresso has a really nice texture, it's neither sour nor bitter, perfectly balanced, very sweet and just very enjoyable in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The single and the small double baskets however only have holes in the middle and are kind of shaped like a funnel.

I have tried adjusting a lot of factors and could not get an espresso that was as good as with the double basket. I tried adjusting temperature, pump pressure, grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction ratio. I have tried using 7,8, and 9 grams of coffee with a brew ratio of 1.8 to 2.5 and none of them were as good as with the double basket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what I tried, the espresso always had that channeling taste. It was sour and bitter at the same time. Inspecting the pucks afterwards showed no clear sign of channeling most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this frustrating ordeal I just went back to using the double basket, which clearly makes better espresso (I even did a blind test to see if I can tell the difference, I got 4 out of 4 right).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are single baskets just not made for specialty coffee?

The coffee is fresh (~7 days from roasting) specialty coffee, light to medium roast.

It's full stream for 5 secs (pre-infusion), then off for 4 secs and then on again to brew the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put 18 grams of coffee in and I'm aiming for ~38g of coffee out in 25 seconds after the first drop of espresso lands in the cup.

To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)

For almost all varietals of beans, my target roast levels end up in the 14:30 to 16:00 minute range for a half pound of green coffee beans.  Recently, however, I have been experimenting with significantly longer roasts (~30% to 50% longer).  I set the machine to max (482F) let it run 12 minutes or so, then crank it down to 425F or so and run to just short of target.  Generally this has been adding 4 to 8 minutes to my roasts times.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The obvious disadvantage is the extra time it takes me to be involved with the roast.  The advantage I was going for was that it is much easier to hit a target roast with such a long window at the &quot;end of roast&quot;.  However, I seem to notice another potential advantage.  The coffee seems to taste much better after much shorter rest times.  With my old shorter method coffees came into their peak seemingly around 72 to 96 hours later.  With this new method, the coffee seems to be hitting that same stride at 24 or 48 hours.

With the cold brew method (where you stir the ground coffee in cold water for a minute) I can get something very refreshing and tea-like, but with hot brew methods I've had very inconsistent results with the James Hoffmann method, the bypass method, and the pourover method, using supermarket medium roast decaf beans, as well as supermarket light roast beans. Sometimes I get coffee that borders on delicious, and sometimes it's worse than the coffee I can buy at Sonic. I'm using filtered water and I'm grinding my coffee twice, once at double the number of clicks and then again at the actual intended number, as I've heard that makes for a more consistent grind with the Hario slim.

I currently cannot afford a nicer grinder, so I'm looking to see if there are any other tricks I can do to get more consistent coffee. I know with cheap beans and a cheap grinder that there's an upper limit on how nice it can be, but it would still be nice to have a consistent 5-6/10 cup instead of the 2-7/10 range I've been getting.
